Sigfried Giedion, an art historian and one of the most influential thinkers in modern architectural theory, writes in Space, Time and Architecture (1941) that architecture is &ldquo;so bound up with the life of a period as a whole&rdquo; that it inevitably reveals how societies function and evolve. Buildings are not just the backdrop to human life; they are part of how society works, remembers, and changes. They hold meaning, in many ways, not only because of who built them or when, but because of how people have used and lived with them over time.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c5\">In Nanded, architecture has served as both a witness to and participant in historical change. The district&rsquo;s built landscape tells the story of shifting power, belief, and identity. Each structure carries traces of the time it was built, the people who shaped it, and the communities that gave it purpose.</span></p>'),(2553,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c5\">The built heritage of Nanded district reflects a confluence of dynasties, faiths, and architectural traditions that shaped the Deccan over centuries. From early rock-cut forms and medieval stone mandirs to fortified towns and 19th-century Sikh monuments, the district holds sites that mark shifting political and cultural landscapes. Post-Vakataka cave architecture at Shiur, Chalukyan mandir design at Hottal, Rashtrakuta and Sultanate-era influences at Kandhar Fort, and the Indo-Sikh style of Takhat Sachkhand Sri Hazur Sahib reveal how varied dynasties left their mark on Nanded&rsquo;s built environment. Regional traditions blend with external influences, as seen in structures like the Kaleshwar Mandir, where South Indian forms meet local mandir styles. Together, these sites trace Nanded&rsquo;s long history of exchange, continuity, and adaptation through built form.</span></p>'),(2555,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c5\">The Shiur Caves in Hadgaon Taluka, Nanded district, are an early example of rock-cut architecture and follow a simple, post-Vakataka style. Carved into a low rocky outcrop along the eastern face near the Penganga River, the caves are dated to the post-Vakataka period (after 5th century CE), likely under the brief rule of the Vishnukundin dynasty from Andhra Pradesh. The caves are significant for their rare Vaishnavite iconography and their stylistic links with cave architecture in Vidarbha, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh.</span></p>'),(2557,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c5\">The Shiur Caves consist of three rectangular excavations, each divided into a nave and aisles by crude square pillars. The interiors are unadorned except for carvings of Vishnu and scenes from the Harivamsa, such as Kaliyamardan and Putana Vadh, found on the pillar faces. While Cave I and Cave II contain rudimentary mandirs carved into the rear wall, Cave III features an unfinished circumambulatory passage and a later-added Shivling and Nandi. Unlike the more refined Brahmanical and Buddhist caves in western India, the Shiur caves lack formal facades and carved entrances, instead displaying a raw, functional style. Their emphasis on pillar carvings over wall sculpture points to regional artistic exchange across the Deccan.</span></p>'),(2559,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c5\">The Siddheshwar Mandir in Hottal village, Nanded district, is an important 12th-century Shiv Mandir built in the Hemadpanthi architectural style during the Kalyani-Chalukya period. Located near the Maharashtra-Karnataka-Andhra Pradesh border, Hottal&mdash;historically known as Navaru or Pottal&mdash;was once a sub-principality under the Chalukya dynasty. The Mandir reflects the skilled stonework and intricate design associated with the later Chalukya rulers, particularly under Somesvara II (1068&ndash;1076 CE).</span></p>'),(2561,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c5\">The Siddheshwar Mandir features local stone masonry, elaborate carvings, and a traditional layout that includes subsidiary mandirs. It is part of a larger Mandir complex that includes the Mahadeva Mandir, Nandi Mandir, and Parashurama Mandir, all of which are state-protected monuments. Restoration work in 2012 helped preserve the Mandir&rsquo;s historic character while maintaining the integrity of its original design.</span></p>'),(2563,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c5\">Kandhar Fort is located in Kandhar town of Nanded district, built in a style that combines early Deccan and Indo-Islamic architectural influences. The fort is situated along the banks of the Manyad River and spans approximately 24 acres. Its origins are traditionally traced to the Kakatiya dynasty (between the 9th and 14th centuries CE), with structural contributions made during later periods by the Rashtrakutas, Delhi Sultanate, Ahmadnagar Sultanate, and Mughals.</span></p>'),(2565,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c5\">Kandhar Fort is believed to have originally been constructed using wood and later rebuilt in black stone. The existing fort features a 12-meter-high enclosure wall and two layers of fortification. The inner wall has undergone some restoration, while the outer wall is largely in ruins. The moat surrounding the fort is attributed to the Rashtrakuta period, and its depth and water-filled design served as a key defensive mechanism.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c5\">Kandhar Fort incorporates strategic features such as 18 watchtowers, multiple bastions, and cannons placed along its perimeter. Entry to the fort is through grand stone gateways like the Jinsi Gate, Machali Gate, and Rangin Darwaza, each showcasing intricate stonework. The fort&rsquo;s flat terrain required strong fortification and clever engineering to withstand attacks, which is evident in its layered ramparts and defensive layout.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c5\">Kandhar Fort houses several significant structures such as the Sheesh Mahal, Ambar Khana, Rani Mahal, and Lal Mahal. The Sheesh Mahal, likely built over an earlier Rashtrakuta palace, still retains elements of glasswork and remnants of a bath with separate hot and cold-water storage. The Ambar Khana functioned as a granary, while the Rani and Lal Mahals reflect Mughal architectural influences and were used for residential and administrative purposes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c5\">Kandhar Fort also contains unique features such as a stepwell from the Yadava period and a man-made reservoir known as Jatatunsagar. Religious figures placed within the fort include Mahavir, Bhagwaan Ganesh, and Shivlings. On a nearby hillock stands an Ancient Idgah, indicating the site&rsquo;s continued spiritual and cultural relevance across centuries.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c5\">One of the most distinctive features of Kandhar Fort is a 60-foot-tall stone yaksha statue, attributed to the Rashtrakuta period. The scale and craftsmanship of this sculpture reflect the artistic excellence of early medieval Deccan art and suggest the fort&rsquo;s importance as both a military and cultural center.</span></p>'),(2568,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c5\">Takhat Sachkhand Sri Hazur Sahib in Nanded is an early 19th-century Sikh gurdwara built in Indo-Sikh architectural style, with gilded domes and marble inlay work. It is one of the five takhts (seats of authority) in Sikhism and holds deep historical significance as the site where Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru, spent his final days and passed away in 1708.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c5\">The construction of the current structure was commissioned by Maharaja Ranjit Singh and completed between 1832 and 1837. The main sanctum, Angitha Sahib, marks the cremation spot of Guru Gobind Singh. It features intricately gold-plated walls and a dome topped with a gold-plated copper kalash. The site blends spiritual reverence with regal architectural grandeur.</span></p>'),(2571,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c5\">The Kaleshwar Mandir in Vishnupuri near Nanded is built in a blend of South Indian and Maharashtrian architectural styles. The Mandir is dedicated to Bhagwaan Shiv and is centered around a swayambhu Shivling, believed to have manifested naturally. It is located along the banks of the Godavari River, approximately 8 km from Nanded city. While the exact date of construction is unclear, local traditions trace the Mandir&rsquo;s origins to a time when a cow was observed pouring milk at the site possibly a hundred years ago in the early 20th century, leading to the discovery of the Shivling and the establishment of the Mandir.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c5\">The Kaleshwar Mandir features stone pillars and a carved roof, with detailed reliefs depicting scenes from the Ramayan and Mahabharat. These carvings integrate devotional storytelling into the structural elements of the Mandir. The use of sculpted columns to support the roof reflects southern influence, while the overall layout and devotional focus are typical of regional mandir forms found in Maharashtra.</span></p>'),(2580,'<p id=\"h.55zdhfu496b2\" class=\"c21 title\"><span class=\"c5 c22\">Artforms: Nanded</span></p>'),(2583,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c5 c3\">Bharud is a dramatic performance art and poetic form that holds a central place in festivals and fairs in Nanded. It combines elements of music, drama, and elocution, often conveying spiritual themes. The development and popularization of this art form, notably, is closely tied to Sant Eknath and the Bhakti movement. </span></p>'),(2585,'<p class=\"c25\"><span class=\"c5 c3\">A Bharud typically features a lead performer known as the Veenekari, who is accompanied by a mridang player, a harmonium player, and a group of 15 to 20 taalkari (supporting dancers). The performance is, in many ways, dynamic, integrating rhythmic movements, call-and-response singing, and expressive narration that all in all engage the audience.</span></p>'),(2587,'<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Dindi is a folk dance traditionally performed on Ekadashi (the eleventh day of the lunar fortnight) in the month of Karthik (October&ndash;November). Closely associated with religious devotion, it features songs that often depict the playful childhood acts of Krishna. The dance is characterized by its energetic and rhythmic movements, making it engaging for both children and adults.</span></p>'),(2590,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c5 c3\">Vaman Pandit was a scholar and poet known for his extensive and diverse body of work. His narrative poems were widely popular among both the general public and Kirtankars. Many scholars regard his most significant contribution as providing a philosophical foundation for Bhakti (devotion). His poetry is characterized by dramatic elements, allegory, and intricate wordplay, along with a structured and refined style.</span></p>'),(2592,'<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c5 c3\">Pandit had equal mastery over both Marathi and Sanskrit and was highly regarded for his poetic excellence, which earned him the title &lsquo;Sushlok Vaman&rsquo;. His favorite literary devices included rhyme, alliteration, and self-quotation, which led to him being referred to as &lsquo;Vamkya-Vaman&rsquo;. </span></p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3 c5\">He was born into a Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmin (DRB) family of the Madhva Sampradaya in Dharwad, Karnataka. He belonged to the Sesha family, a lineage known for its poets and scholars. However, Nanded was an important place to him as it was his and his family&rsquo;s ancestral home. </span></p>'),(2595,'<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c5 c3\">Hottal is a small village in Nanded, known for its rich historical heritage. The village was once a Chalukyan territory and features many structures dating back from that period including an ancient Siddheshwar Mandir. </span></p>'),(2597,'<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c5 c3\">To honor this history, the Hottal Festival is organized to raise awareness of this legacy, celebrating the village&rsquo;s history and traditions. During the festival, visitors learn about the ancient 11th century Kalash-Chalukyan Mandirs, which the Archaeological Department and the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums are currently actively restoring. The festival, in many ways, provides an opportunity for both visitors and locals to learn about the history and architectural legacy of this village.</span></p>'),(2600,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3\">The Indian School of Design (INSD) in Nanded is an educational institution focused on creative disciplines such as fashion, interior design, graphic design, and jewelry design. The institution integrates theoretical learning with practical training, preparing students for careers in the design industry.</span></p>'),(2605,'<p id=\"h.ct2dvw7tarn8\" class=\"c30 title\"><span class=\"c3 c60\">LANGUAGE: NANDED</span></p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">Language has played a central role in shaping India&rsquo;s political and regional boundaries, particularly during the post-independence period. One of the most significant turning points was the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, which redefined state borders based on linguistic identity.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">In the Marathwada region, which was formerly part of the Hyderabad State, this reorganisation brought major changes. After Hyderabad was merged into the Indian Union, areas with a dominant Marathi-speaking population, including Nanded district, were integrated into the state of Maharashtra in 1960. Even so today, much like any other part of India, Nanded is home to a range of language communities, each preserving its own way of speaking. While Marathi remains the most widely spoken language, others such as Urdu, Hindi, and Banjari are also significant. Smaller groups speak languages like Gondi and Ghisadi, reflecting the district&rsquo;s deep-rooted linguistic diversity.</span></p>'),(2607,'<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">At the time of the 2011 Census, Nanded district had a total population of approximately 33.61 lakh (33,61,292). Of this population, 75.46% reported Marathi as their first language. Urdu was spoken by 9.63%, followed by Hindi (5.52%), Banjari (4.95%), and Telugu (2.10%). Other languages spoken as mother tongues included Gondi (0.83%), Lamani/Lambadi (0.29%), Marwari (0.28%), Kannada (0.24%), Punjabi (0.16%), Gujarati (0.14%), and Vadari (0.06%).</span></p>'),(2610,'<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">Gondi is a language spoken by the Gond people across central India, including states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and Gujarat. In Nanded district, according to the 2011 Census, 27,934 people reported Gondi as their mother tongue, making up 0.83% of the district&rsquo;s total population.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">The origins of Gondi have been the subject of multiple theories. The traditional view maintains that Gondi has primarily existed as an oral language without a written script. However, it has been noted in the </span><span class=\"c2 c7\">Languages of Maharashtra </span><span class=\"c3 c2\">(2017) that this perspective has been challenged by scholars such as Motiram Kale, who argues that Gondi is an ancient language that once served as the official language of the ancient Gondwana Kingdom, complete with its own script and literary tradition. Scholar Vyankatesh Atram claims that hieroglyphs discovered in Gondwana are actually Gondi script and that it served as the official language of the Kuyava Kingdom in the pre-Rigveda period. According to this theory, the written script disappeared when Duryon, the Kuyava capital, was destroyed around 3201 BCE.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">Despite these historical shifts, this language has endured beautifully in its oral form. Unfortunately, it has been classified as a &ldquo;vulnerable language&rdquo; in UNESCO&rsquo;s 2009 report, which states that while most children still speak Gondi, its use may be restricted to certain domains.</span></p>'),(2612,'<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">Gondi is classified as part of the Dravidian language family in the Chandrapur Gazetteer (1972) and as mentioned above, is spoken across central India. However, rather than existing as a single uniform variety, Gondi exhibits significant dialectal diversity. The influence of surrounding languages, such as Hindi, Marathi, Telugu, Kannada, and Chhattisgarhi, has contributed to regional variations in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammatical structures.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c2\">Gondi has a distinct sound system (phonology). It is listed in the volume Languages of Maharashtra (2017), that there are more than 13 vowel sounds (counting all the short, long, uncommon vowels and diphthongs) and more than 37 consonant sounds in the Gondi language.

He guided Raja Raghuji and his troops to a fertile location near the hills, where the sant performed ceremonies to sanctify the spot and call upon divine forces to preserve the lake\'s life.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c3\">The construction of the lake, led by the sant, involved workers from across the nation. As the months passed, an underground spring began to replenish the lake with crystal-clear water, fulfilling the sant\'s prophecy. Futala Lake quickly became an essential resource for the people of Nagpur. The once-dry fields grew lush with crops, and the people cheered. The lake\'s waters never receded, even during the most brutal summers, seemingly blessed with an unending supply of vitality.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c3\">Appreciative of the sant\'s guidance, Raja Raghuji designated the lake as a holy site. He created a lovely garden around it, providing a space where people could unwind and enjoy the natural beauty. Futala Lake soon became a popular destination for picnics, festivals, and gatherings.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c5\"><span>As Nagpur expanded and modernized, Futala Lake remained an integral part of the district, and the sacred tree placed by the saint continues to stand.</span></p>'),(2903,'<p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c3\">Once upon a time, in the dense forests surrounding Nagpur, there lived an elderly mother who wished to visit her daughter.

The old lady, still in her pumpkin disguise, replied that she was just a pumpkin and kept singing \"Chal re bhoplya tunuk tunuk\" as she rushed ahead. The suspicious dog pursued her, but the old lady\'s clever disguise and quick thinking allowed her to escape.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c5\"><span>Next, the tiger approached the pumpkin and asked about the old lady. The old lady, still in her pumpkin disguise, claimed ignorance. Frustrated, the tiger cut the pumpkin open, only to realize it was the same old lady.

They came across a peaceful hilltop where Ram decided to rest for a while.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c3\">While resting, Ram learned about the evil forces causing trouble in nearby villages. Feeling a strong sense of duty, he vowed to defeat the evil threatening the land. From that day on, the hill was called Ramtek, meaning \"Ram\'s Pledge,\" in honor of his determination.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c3\">The story of Ramtek continued until the 18th century when the powerful Bhonsle dynasty rose to prominence in the region. The founder, Raghoji I, heard about the sacred site and felt a deep spiritual connection to it.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c3\">While bathing in the Ambala reservoir at the foot of the hill, Raghoji made a promise: if he won his next battle at Devgadh, he would build a grand Mandir for Bhagwaan Ram on Ramtek hill. After Raghoji\'s forces succeeded, he began to fulfill his vow. He invited the best artisans from across the kingdom to create beautiful murtis of Ram, Sita, and Lakshman. On the eve of the Mandir’s inauguration, Raghoji received a miraculous vision revealing that ancient murtis were buried in the nearby Sur River.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c3\">Raghoji\'s troops found these sacred murtis and placed them alongside the new ones, creating a stunning Mandir complex. He built a strong fort to protect the site and ensured that the pujaris and workers were well cared for, so the Mandir’s rituals could continue forever.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c3\">The Ramtek Gad Mandir, commonly known as the Shri Ram Mandir, honors Raghoji I\'s devotion. Located atop the 345-meter-high Ramgiri Hill, the Mandir is famous for its unique 350-foot-long \"OM\" structure, with carvings from the Ramayana and Krishna Leela. The Mandir also features murtis of Hanuman, Sai Baba, and Gajanan Maharaj.</span></p>'),(2915,'<p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c3\">The Mahabharat mentions Babruvahana, the son of the great warrior Arjuna and Ulupi, a princess from the Naga (serpent) clan. This takes place after the famous Kurukshetra War, a major battle that changed the fate of the Kuru dynasty.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c3\">Babruvahana became the ruler of a region after the war. As the son of Arjuna, one of the five Pandava brothers known for their bravery, he had a strong legacy to uphold. However, the war had left many conflicts unresolved, especially regarding power and territory. To prove his strength and authority, Arjuna performed a ritual called the ashvamedha yajna. This involved releasing a sacred horse that roamed freely. Any king who captured the horse would challenge Arjuna and show their own power. This ritual was a way for Arjuna to expand his influence.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c3\">During the yajna, Babruvahana captured the sacred horse at Khoon village, near the Dhar Udhampur road. This act was a direct challenge to Arjuna\'s authority. In the battle that followed, Babruvahana killed Arjuna, a tragic event that changed everything. After his victory, Babruvahana presented Arjuna\'s head to his mother, Ulupi. When he learned that Arjuna was his father, he felt deep regret and wanted to bring him back to life. To do this, Babruvahana needed to get a magical gem called the Mani from Shesha, the serpent bhagwan.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c3\">To reach Shesha, Babruvahana used his arrow to create a tunnel known as Surangsar. This tunnel allowed him to enter Shesha\'s realm. When he faced Shesha, Babruvahana fought bravely. After a fierce battle, he defeated Shesha and took the Mani.

Sigfried Giedion, an art historian and one of the most influential thinkers in modern architectural theory, writes in </span><span class=\"c9 c24\">Space, Time and Architecture</span><span class=\"c2\"> (1941) that architecture is “so bound up with the life of a period as a whole” that it inevitably reveals how societies function and evolve. Buildings are not just the backdrop to human life; they are part of how society works, remembers, and changes. They hold meaning, in many ways, not only because of who built them or when, but because of how people have used and lived with them over time.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">In Nagpur, architecture has served as both a witness to and participant in historical change. The district’s built landscape tells the story of shifting power, belief, and identity. Each structure carries traces of the time it was built, the people who shaped it, and the communities that gave it purpose.</span></p>'),(2918,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Nagpur’s architectural landscape reflects a confluence of diverse cultural, religious, and political influences shaped over centuries. From ancient mandirs like Ramtek Gad Mandir, showcasing the Hemadpanthi style of the Yadav period, to medieval forts like Dongartal blending Mughal and Maratha elements, the district’s prominent sites narrate stories of religious practice and political history. In more recent times, structures like Deekshabhoomi and Dragon Palace Mandir bring in Buddhist and Japanese influences, contributing to Nagpur’s evolving identity as a center of spiritual and social movements. Together, these architectural landmarks reveal how Nagpur’s built heritage embodies both continuity and transformation—preserving historical roots while embracing new cultural expressions.</span></p>'),(2920,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Ramtek Gad Mandir follows the Hemadpanthi architectural style of the Yadav period (1187–1317 CE) and is located on Ramgiri Hill within a fort-like structure in Ramtek, near Nagpur. The Mandir was renovated and expanded in the 18th century by Raje Raghuji Bhonsale I of Nagpur.</span></p>'),(2922,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Ramtek Gad Mandir is noted for its intricate carvings on the shikharas and walls, showcasing depictions and sculptures of the Ramayan, Krishna Leela, Bhagwan Hanuman, Sai Baba, and Gajanan Maharaj. At the base of the hill stands a unique “OM” structure, measuring 350 ft. long, 10.5 ft. high, and 11 ft. wide, adorned with different sculptures. Together, the Mandir and surrounding structures reflect a blend of medieval and later architectural influences while preserving deep cultural and religious significance.</span></p>'),(2924,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Dongartal Fort follows a blend of Mughal and Maratha architectural styles and is located near the Maharashtra–Madhya Pradesh border, close to Pench National Park.

Each corner of the fort features a minaret, while the fortified walls are lined with merlons for added defense and visual appeal. A square bell stands in front of the fort, adding to its distinct features. The fort is surrounded by hills, a lake, and dense teak forests, making it a rare example of a medieval vandurg or forest fort.</span></p>'),(2928,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Dragon Palace Mandir follows a blend of Japanese and Buddhist architectural styles and is located in Nagpur.

The stupa was inaugurated on 18 December 2001.</span></p>'),(2934,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Deekshabhoomi’s stupa is a large, two-storied hemispherical structure modeled after the famous stupa at Sanchi, but unlike Sanchi’s solid design, it is hollow inside. It is the largest hollow stupa in the world, with an inner circular hall spread over 4,000 sq. ft. The stupa was built using granite, marble, and Dholpur sandstone, and incorporates four gateways with carvings of Dhammachakras, horses, elephants, and lions in Rajasthani marble.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">The stupa’s upper structure uses an innovative Central Block Locking System, with a diameter of 120 ft. It is supported by a series of columns arranged in four expanding layers, with space to accommodate more than 5,000 people inside. The ground floor, covering over 20,000 sq. ft., serves as a puja hall.</span></p>'),(2936,'<p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c2\">Architecture has long served as a record of everyday life, shaped by the people who inhabit it and the broader conditions of the time in which it is built. This is especially true of residential spaces, which carry subtle imprints of the cultural, social, and material contexts in which they were formed. As Amos Rapoport observes in House, Form, and Culture (1969), “The house is an institution...influenced by the cultural milieu to which it belongs.” Homes are spaces we occupy daily, yet few reflect on how they are built or the stories embedded within them. Unlike monumental structures that showcase the grandeur of dynasties, domestic spaces quietly preserve the everyday practices, values, and histories passed down through generations. Yet, some houses remain, carrying with them traces of the past that continue to shape the present.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c2\">In Nagpur, these layers are visible across its urban landscape. Buildings from different periods sit side by side, often altered or adapted, but still bearing the marks of earlier times. As newer constructions rise and older ones fade, these structures offer a way to understand the district’s changing histories, not only through what has been preserved, but also through what continues to be lived in.</span></p>'),(2938,'<p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c2\">Sitabuldi is a locality situated in the Nagpur taluka which is often considered to be one of the busiest areas of the district. Perhaps this description, in many ways, seeps into the character of its streets that are often narrow in their character. Aside from this, the locality is also known for its rich history. Notably, it is not odd to find many old structures lined across its streets, whose stories and origins are tied to historical figures and events. One such structure is the Pardhi Wada, a three-storey residence which stands in one of Sitabuldi’s narrower lanes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c2\">The lane where it lies has a very interesting story. It is said that a collection of wadas were constructed here under the patronage of Raje Raghuji Bhonsle, the Maratha Chief of the Bhonsle dynasty. Many structures from this residential cluster have since been renovated or replaced with contemporary buildings. However, a few structures remain which attest to this legacy, with the Pardhi Wada being one of them. </span></p>\n<p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c9 c10\">As the name suggests, the </span><span class=\"c9\">w</span><span class=\"c9 c10\">ada has long been home to the Pardhi family. </span><span class=\"c9\">Interestingly, the wada</span><span class=\"c9 c10\"> continues to remain as the family’s home even today, with 17 members currently residing in it. The </span><span class=\"c9\">w</span><span class=\"c9 c10\">ada and the family share a deep bond that goes back to the early 19th century. It is believed that during this time, Raje Raghuji Bhonsle gifted this </span><span class=\"c9\">w</span><span class=\"c2\">ada to the family. He is also believed to have conferred upon them the surname ‘Pardhi,’ in place of their earlier name, Aurangabadkar. </span></p>\n<p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c9 c10\">The architectural design of the Pardhi Wada aligns much with the broader principles of </span><span class=\"c9\">w</span><span class=\"c9 c10\">ada architecture. It features a high plinth, smaller window openings, and intricately carved wooden elements that adorn its structure. Aside from that, its architectural language, like many </span><span class=\"c9\">w</span><span class=\"c2\">adas, draws inspiration from fort architecture. This influence is particularly evident in the structure’s most distinctive features.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c9 c10\">One of the most </span><span class=\"c9\">notable </span><span class=\"c9 c10\">aspects of the </span><span class=\"c9\">w</span><span class=\"c9 c10\">ada lies in its terrace parapet, which features pointed </span><span class=\"c9\">chaarya </span><span class=\"c9 c10\">(</span><span class=\"c9\">merlons</span><span class=\"c9 c10\">) and </span><span class=\"c9\">jangyaa </span><span class=\"c9 c10\">(</span><span class=\"c9\">embrasures</span><span class=\"c2\">). Both are features that are typically found in Maratha fortifications. These elements give the residence a far more commanding and regal appearance. </span></p>'),(2940,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c9\">These elements are interesting for two reasons. Sitabuldi was the site of a battle between the Marathas and the British in the early 19th century, and perhaps their presence here could have a link to the socio-political climate of that</span><span class=\"c2\"> time. They may also point to the Wada’s connection to the Bhonsles, standing as a quiet tribute to this legacy.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c9 c10\">Other than the parapet, another distinctive feature of the </span><span class=\"c9\">w</span><span class=\"c9 c10\">ada is the jharokha, a small overhanging window which is located at one end of the </span><span class=\"c9\">w</span><span class=\"c2\">ada.

Notably, placement and standalone presence make it all the more eye-catching.</span></p>'),(2942,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c8 c10\">Both of these elements make the </span><span class=\"c8\">w</span><span class=\"c8 c10\">ada stand out, perhaps even more so because such designs are gradually fading away from contemporary architecture practices. This contrast becomes even more pronounced along the lane where Pardhi Wada stands, as the surrounding streetscape continues to change.

Apart from these grains, Nagpur is known for its production of oranges. Nagpur oranges, known for their distinctive sweet-sour flavor and high juice content, are a prominent agricultural product of the Nagpur region in Maharashtra, India. These oranges have been granted a Geographical Indication (GI) tag, ensuring that only those grown in this specific area can be marketed under the name \"Nagpur oranges\". The cultivation of these oranges dates back over a century, believed to have originated from sweet orange varieties introduced by the British. Local farmers have since developed a unique variety well-suited to the region\'s hot and dry climate, characterized by red clayey soil rich in nutrients.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c7 c2 c4 c14\">Harvesting typically occurs between October and January, with two main crops: the slightly sour Ambiya crop available from September to December and the sweeter Mrig crop harvested in January. However, recent challenges such as climate change, erratic weather patterns, and pest infestations have threatened the quality and yield of Nagpur oranges. For instance, a warm winter combined with unexpected rainfall has led to significant losses, with estimates suggesting up to 50% of the crop may have been affected this season alone. Farmers have reported receiving drastically lower prices for their produce due to these adverse conditions, highlighting the economic vulnerability faced by those dependent on orange cultivation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c10\"><span class=\"c7 c2 c4\">Despite these challenges, Nagpur oranges remain a vital export commodity, with India exporting approximately 1.5 lakh tonnes annually, valued at over ₹200 crore.

According to popular belief, Kalidas visited Ramtek during his travels and composed verses that immortalized its natural beauty. Today, the festival pays tribute to that literary legacy by bringing together artists and audiences from across India.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">The performances take place near the historic Ramtek Mandir complex, which overlooks the surrounding hills and lakes. This picturesque setting adds a timeless charm to the festival. Over two days, acclaimed performers present a variety of classical forms including Bharatanatyam, Odissi, Hindustani vocal, and theatre productions inspired by Kalidas’s works. Each performance is carefully curated to reflect the artistic excellence that Kalidas himself is known for.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">The Kalidas Festival serves as a cultural bridge that connects contemporary audiences with the artistic and intellectual legacy of ancient India. It also revives the spirit of Vidarbha’s golden era, celebrating the region’s continued contribution to India’s cultural landscape. The festival is attended by scholars, artists, and cultural enthusiasts alike, making it one of the most anticipated events in the district’s annual calendar.</span></p>'),(3004,'<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">Marbat Utsav is a unique cultural festival celebrated annually in Nagpur, primarily on the second day of the Tanha Pola festival in August or September. It is one of the region’s most distinct traditions, where effigies symbolizing evil forces or societal problems are paraded through the streets and ritually burned or immersed to ward off negativity and protect the city from harm.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">The festival dates back to the 19th century and originated as a symbolic protest during the colonial period. The effigies, known as Marbats, are made from clay, hay, and cloth. The two main effigies are Kala Marbat (Black Marbat) and Pivli Marbat (Yellow Marbat), representing different kinds of negativity or social evils. Smaller figures known as Badgyas, often resembling animals or caricatures of societal concerns, are also created and included in the processions.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">The processions begin from various localities in East Nagpur, especially the Itwari area, and travel around 10 km through the city. The Pivli Marbat is traditionally taken out by the Teli Samaj Mandal in Tarhane, while families such as the Shendes of Jagnath Budhwari and the lineage of Sadashiv Vastad Tadikar have been making these effigies for generations. Participants dress in festive attire, play traditional instruments, and chant slogans that often reflect current social and political issues.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">The highlight of the festival is the ritual burning or immersion of the Marbats at the end of the procession. This act symbolizes the destruction of evil and the collective desire to rid society of corruption, injustice, and other ills. The celebration also includes folk dances, street plays, and community feasts, bringing together people from different communities.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">Marbat Utsav is more than a religious or seasonal observance—it is a form of social expression and collective resilience. With its vibrant visuals, grassroots participation, and emphasis on justice and harmony, the festival remains a powerful symbol of Nagpur’s cultural and civic spirit.</span></p>'),(3006,'<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">The Orange City Craft Mela and Folk Dance Festival is an annual national-level cultural event held in Nagpur.

It provides a platform for artisans and performers to share their work, promote cultural exchange, and celebrate India’s artistic diversity.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">The 31st edition of the festival was celebrated in January 2025 with exhibitions and sales of handicrafts such as hand block printing, Jamdani, Banarasi weaving, and embroidery, along with folk dances like Ghoomar, Rouf, Siddhi Dhamal, Karkattam, and Singhi Cham. Around 100 artisans and 300 dancers from various states participated, making it a vibrant showcase of craft and performance.</span></p>'),(3008,'<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">The Ramnavami Jatra is the main annual festival celebrated in Ramtek, a historic town named after Bhagwaan Ram. Held from Chaitra Sud. 1 to Chaitra Sud. 11 (March–April), the jatra marks the birth anniversary of Bhagwaan Ram. Another significant fair takes place from Kartika Sud. 11 to Kartika Sud. 15 (October–November) and commemorates the slaying of the rakshas Tripurasur. Ramtek, located about 1,508 ft. above sea level to the northeast of Nagpur, serves as the taluka headquarters.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">The Ramnavami Fair is centered around the Ram Mandir, which stands atop a hill variously known as Ramgiri, Shendurgiri, or Tapogiri. The Mandir is situated 500 ft. above the town, in the westernmost part of the Ambagarh ranges. Stone steps that begin at the Ambala Tank on the eastern side, passing a masjid said to have been built in memory of Aurangzeb’s courtiers, lead to the Mandir. The Mandir complex is accessible via multiple entrance gates—Varaha Darwaja, Sinhapur Darwaja, Bhairao Darwaja, and Gokul Darwaja—each leading into different courtyards.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">The Ramnavami Jatra features various rituals and sites of worship within the Mandir complex. Several tirthsthans dedicated to devtas such as Dhumreshwar, Nrisinha, Trivikram, Varaha, and Vishnu attract pilgrims. A large Varaha murti, built by Raghuji Bhonsale I, stands just inside the Varaha Darwaja. Other notable structures include a Krishna Mandir of the Mahanubhav sect, a Radhakrishna Mandir near the Nagarkhana, and a Sabhamandap supported by eight pillars, where bhajans, kirtans, and pravachans are held.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">The most significant Ramnavami festivities are celebrated between Chaitra Sud. 9 and Chaitra Sud. 11. On Chaitra Sud. 9, the Ram Janmotsav is celebrated by placing a small murti of Bhagwaan Ram in a cradle at noon, following a katha recital by the pujari. Large crowds gather for darshan, bhajans, and kirtans. On Chaitra Sud. 10, sweets are distributed as prasad, while Chaitra Sud. 11 features the Dahi Handi ritual, where a pot of curd is broken and parched rice is sprinkled on the people.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">The Kartika Fair, held in October–November, follows a similar format of activities. From Kartika Sud. 11 onward, bhajans and kirtans are held leading up to Tripuri Purnima (Kartika Sud. 15). On that day, a ritual abhishek is performed for the devtas, and in the evening, a yellow silk cloth is burned in a gangal (brass pot) on the Mandir roof to symbolize the defeat of Tripurasur. During Navratri, flags are hoisted on Dasara, and an effigy of Ravan is burned in the Mandir courtyard.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">The murtis of Bhagwaan Ram and Laxman, and Devi Sita, in the Ram Mandir are carved from black marble and depict them during their 14-year exile. Bhagwaan Ram and Laxman wear jata (matted hair), angarkha, uparne, and dhoti, while Devi Sita is adorned in a sari, blouse, and traditional ornaments. The murtis are crowned in gold, and daily puja rituals begin early in the morning with bathing of the murtis, floral decoration, incense, and aarti.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">According to locals, Bhagwaan Ram, Laxman, and Devi Sita stayed on this hill during their exile. In 1736, Raghuji Bhonsale is believed to have taken a vow at Ramtek before attacking Deogad. After his victory, he intended to install marble murtis from Jaipur in the Mandir but reportedly received a divine vision instructing him to retrieve the existing ones from the Sur River. These murtis were installed in 1753, further enhancing the spiritual importance of Ramtek.</span></p>'),(3011,'<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">Tanha Pola is a unique festival celebrated in Nagpur, observed a day after the traditional Pola festival. It has been a part of the district’s cultural fabric for over two centuries and centers around honoring bulls for their contribution to agriculture.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">The origins of Tanha Pola are traced back to 1789, when Shrimant Raje Raghuji Maharaj Bhonsale II is believed to have initiated the tradition. The festival was introduced as a way to educate young cowherds about the importance of bulls in farming and rural livelihoods. Aligned to this aim, children worship wooden bulls during the festival, which are specially decorated for the occasion. A major highlight of the festival is the procession of children carrying these wooden bulls through the streets. Elaborate symbolic gates made of sweets, sugarcanes, and puffed rice are placed along the route. These are ceremonially broken down during the procession, and the children are then given sweets and money as a gesture of reward and celebration.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">Tanha Pola continues to be an important tradition in Nagpur, blending agricultural symbolism with intergenerational community participation.</span></p>'),(3014,'<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c7\">Tirpur Purnima is a four-day annual festival celebrated at the Ramtek Gad Mandir in Nagpur district.

The procession passes through the Ram Mandir and travels across the taluka, with participants performing cultural tableaux and folk acts. It concludes at Nehru Ground, where prizes are distributed for the performances.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span>On the second day, which marks the full moon, two key rituals take place at the Ramtek Gad Mandir. The worn-out clothes of the Ram and Lakshman murtis, used throughout the year, are ceremonially gathered and burnt near the Mandir’s kalash. Simultaneously, leftover cotton wicks (</span><span class=\"c9\">vaat</span><span class=\"c7\">) from the lamps are collected and burnt atop the Mandir’s shikhar. This flame is known as the Tipur, from which the festival gets its name—Tirpur Purnima. Historically, the light of the Tipur could be seen from the Raghuji Nagar area in Nagpur. Upon seeing it, a similar Tipur was lit on the shikhar of the Lakshmi Narayan Mandir built by Raje Raghuji in that locality. A vibrant fair was once held in Sakkardara on this day, featuring swings, Chandan decorations, wrestling matches, and local entertainment.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span>The third day of the festival is marked by </span><span class=\"c9\">Mandai</span><span>, a cultural programme held in Ramtek.

Remains from the Vakataka period (3rd–5th centuries CE) found at Kohla suggest long-term occupation. This region also witnessed the influence of the Mauryas, Satavahanas, and Vakatakas, with Nagpur emerging as a major center by the 4th century CE.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) uncovered settlement and burial areas in two zones. The first revealed artifacts from both the Iron Age and Early Historic periods, including red ware, black-and-red ware, micaceous red ware, and grey ware from megalithic and Vakataka phases. Over 600 objects were unearthed—among them terracotta and stone beads, ear studs, iron and bone arrowheads, hopscotch game pieces, copper items, and animal bones, including a complete cattle skeleton possibly linked to a ritual called sangada. Structural remains included lime-paved floors, wells, and round bin platforms, possibly used for storage or ceremonial purposes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">The second area yielded a brick structure from the Vakataka period, indicating continued settlement. The burial sites featured typical Vidarbha-style stone circles and standing stones, though no coffin burials were found at Kohla. Iron tools and weapons point to advanced metalwork, likely used for agriculture or construction. Based on the finds, the community appears to have relied on rice, ragi, and pulse cultivation, supplemented by hunting and animal husbandry—practices sustained by fertile valleys and iron technology.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Kohla’s remains provide important insights into Vidarbha’s Iron Age society—an indigenous community skilled in metalworking, early agriculture, and complex ritual traditions. The stone circles and pillars link Kohla to over 100 similar sites across Nagpur, Wardha, and Chandrapur districts. Notable nearby sites like Junapani, with over 300 stone circles, and Mahurjhari, known for horse burials, suggest a society with defined roles such as blacksmiths, farmers, and warriors. Beads and copper items indicate trade networks, while the presence of ritual elements like the cattle skeleton hints at rich ceremonial life. The Vakataka-period structure underscores Kohla’s continued relevance into later historical periods, bridging the Iron Age and early historical era.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">As of April 2025, Kohla remains under the care of the ASI. The artifacts are likely housed in Nagpur’s ASI repository or the Central Museum. However, the Nara Huda mound is vulnerable to agricultural encroachment and looting—issues common across Vidarbha’s rural megalithic sites. While ASI documentation secures the finds, the site itself is not yet open to the public and awaits official monument status. Local awareness remains limited, though recent media attention has sparked some interest. The broader archaeological potential of Umred taluka, particularly along the Wainganga River, suggests that many more sites await discovery in this culturally rich landscape.</span></p>'),(3058,'<p class=\"c4\"><span class=\"c7 c13\">The Maharajab</span><span>agh</span><span class=\"c7 c13\"> zoo in</span><span> Gorepeth, Nagpur</span><span class=\"c7 c13\"> comes under the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) of India and is maintained by the Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth (PKV) of Nagpur.

According to the </span><span class=\"c30\">Gazetteer</span><span class=\"c2\"> (1908), excavations at Nagardhan have revealed coins, pottery, and artifacts from different periods, including the Vakataka era, confirming its long-standing historical presence.

This indicates that Nagardhan held historical significance over the centuries.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">The fort was later strengthened and fortified by the Bhosales of Nagpur, primarily for military defense, administration, and as a royal residence. However, after Nagpur’s annexation in 1853, the fort declined in importance and was no longer used for strategic purposes. Today, it stands as an important historical monument linked to the Bhonsale dynasty and Nagpur’s history.</span></p>'),(3065,'<p class=\"c1\"><span>The Ramtek Gad Mandir, situated on Ramgiri hill inside a fort-like structure, is a notable example of Hemadpanthi architecture from the Yadav period (1187–1317 CE). The Mandir’s Yadav origins are corroborated by an inscription from that period found within the complex. In the 18th century, Raje Raghuji Bhonsale I of Nagpur renovated the Mandir and contributed to its architectural expansion. He also built a residence for the Pujari near the Mandir. This house still exists, and the current priest, Sanjay Pande—who belongs to the 11th generation of the Pande lineage—continues to live in the same house gifted to his ancestors by Raje Bhonsale. However, the Pujaris are not salaried; they earn their livelihood from the ‘daan’ (donations) offered by people visiting the main Mandir. According to an 18th-century contract signed between the Pande family and Raghuji Raje, only the Pande family has the right to collect these offerings.</span></p>'),(3067,'<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">The individual shikharas of each Mandir and the multiple walls of the complex are adorned with intricate carvings.

Alongside these, there are several smaller mandirs devoted to Maruti, Ganpati, Kaushalya (Ram’s mother), and Sumitra (Lakshman’s mother).</span></p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Beyond its Yadav-era origins, the site holds deep associations with tales of Shri Ram and Sita. Several structures within the complex are believed to have been used by them during their time here. These include the Ram Kund, where Ram is said to have bathed; the Sita Chi Nhyani, used by Sita for bathing; and the Sita Rasoi, where she is believed to have cooked meals. The Sita Rasoi continues to serve food to visitors today as prasad. The Mandir also contains an ashram attributed to Agastya Muni, who is believed to have lived here.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Another unique feature is a ‘Varaaha’ structure located on the Mandir premises, said to have been built by Prabhavati Gupta—a Gupta princess and regent of the Vakataka kingdom between 390–410 CE. A local belief tied to this structure suggests that anyone who can slide beneath it easily is not a paapi (sinner).</span></p>'),(3070,'<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">The word “Tek” in Marathi means “to rest” or “to take support.” Locals believe that Bhagwan Ram rested at this location during his Vanvas (exile), giving the place its name—Ramtek, or “the place where Ram rested.” However, another interpretation is shared by the current Pujari. According to this version, “Tek” also means “Sankalp” or “Pratigya” (resolution). Shri Ram is said to have resolved to protect the Rishis from any asuras who disturbed their Yagnas. He defeated one such asur on Tapogiri Parvat, the hill where the Mandir stands today. After the battle, he rested at a spot where his murti still remains. Ram had arrived at Tapogiri from Chitrakoot and, after staying here, continued to Panchavati Ashram in Nashik.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Ramtek is also believed to have been part of the Dandakaranya—the vast forest mentioned in the Ramayan. Over the centuries, the name of the hill evolved from Tapogiri to Sindhuragiri, and finally to Ramgiri. Coincidentally, it is said that the Rishi Agastya Muni was also present on Tapogiri Parvat during Shri Ram’s visit.</span></p>'),(3073,'<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">The Shri Shantinath Jain Mandir, located in Ramtek, is renowned for its spiritual significance, particularly due to the frequent visits of Acharya Shri Vidyasagar Ji Maharaj (1946–2024), a revered Indian Digambara Jain Acharya. He visited the Mandir nine times and observed Chaturmas here on five occasions. The oldest structure within the complex, the Shantinath Mandir, dates back to the 18th century.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">According to locals, Raje Raghuji Bhonsale I—a Maratha general and the founder of the Nagpur branch of the Bhonsale Kingdom—once set out on an excursion into the forests near Ramtek. During a break for lunch, one of his ministers, a devout Jain, refused to eat before having darshan of his Ishta Dev (preferred deity). Concerned, Raje Raghuji dispatched spies to search the forest for a Jain murti. They soon discovered a murti of Shri Shantinath Bhagwan lying beneath a tree.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Upon learning of the discovery, Raje Raghuji and the minister visited the site. They identified the murti by the symbol of a hiran (deer), confirming it as that of Shri Shantinath Bhagwan. Attempts to relocate the murti to the residential part of Ramtek failed repeatedly. Interpreting this as a divine sign, Raje Raghuji ordered the construction of a Mandir at the very spot where the murti was found. This devsthan, now known as the Shantinath Mandir, remains a significant pilgrimage site for the Jain community.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Centuries later, in 1993, a Bhumi Pujan ceremony was held to mark the beginning of a new, grand Mandir: the Shri Ek Hazar Aath Chaubisi Panch Balayati Mandir, which was inaugurated in 2013. Architecturally impressive, it houses the murtis of all 24 Tirthankaras and features intricate carvings crafted by skilled artisans brought in from Rajasthan.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">The Mandir opens daily at 6:00 am.

It was built by the British after they captured the area from the Marathas during the Third Anglo-Maratha War. The fort marks the site of the historic Battle of Sitabuldi, where the East India Company defeated Appa Saheb Bhonsale, the Maratha ruler of Nagpur. This battle was a key turning point in the region’s history and laid the groundwork for the annexation of Nagpur into the British Empire in 1854.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">The fort spans two hillocks—Badi Tekri (big hill) and Choti Tekri (small hill). According to local folklore, the name \"Sitabuldi\" traces its origins to two Yadava brothers, Shitlaprasad and Badriprasad Gawali, who ruled the area in the 17th century. The region was initially known as \"Shitlabadri,\" which evolved into \"Seetabuldee\" under British rule, and eventually became \"Sitabuldi\" or \"Sitabardi.\"</span></p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">During colonial times, the British established the Nagpur Subsidiary Force at Sitabuldi. The northern side of the hillocks was leveled to build an arsenal for artillery and armaments. Other military units were stationed further north in what is now the Chhaoni (cantonment) area. The surrounding land was designated for tent lines, parade grounds, bazaars, hospitals, and stables for cavalry.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">After the revolt of 1857, Nawab Kadar Ali—the grandson of Tipu Sultan—and eight of his associates were executed by hanging from the fort’s ramparts for their involvement in the rebellion.

Nagpur, historically part of the Central Provinces and Berar, became part of Maharashtra in 1960 following the formation of the state. As a result, Marathi is the most widely spoken language in the district. The Marathi spoken in Nagpur reflects local influences, often showing subtle differences in pronunciation, vocabulary, and tone compared to other regions of the state.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span>The district is also home to multiple speech communities (a group of people who use and understand the same language or dialect), each maintaining their own linguistic traditions. Alongside Marathi, languages such as Hindi, Urdu, and Varhadi are also widely spoken. Lesser-known varieties like Dakkhani and Halbi further contribute to the district’s rich and layered linguistic landscape.</span></p>'),(3172,'<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c8\">At the time of the 2011 Census of India, several languages were spoken as mother tongues in Nagpur district. According to the 2011 Census, Nagpur district had a total population of approximately 46,53,570. Of this population, 70.11% reported Marathi as their first language. Hindi was spoken by 17.89%, followed by Urdu (4.20%), Chhattisgarhi (1.39%), Gondi (1.07%), Sindhi (0.95%), Gujarati (0.69%), Telugu (0.60%), Punjabi (0.53%), Bengali (0.41%), Marwari (0.32%), and Halbi (0.29%).</span></p>'),(3175,'<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c8\">Nagpuri Marathi is a language variety of Marathi spoken predominantly in the north-eastern region of Maharashtra, particularly in and around Nagpur, and adjacent areas where Marathi and Hindi bilingualism is common. Notably, Nagpuri Marathi often uses words and sentence styles from both Marathi and Hindi. This makes it different from the Marathi spoken in places like Pune or Mumbai.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c8\">It’s important not to confuse this language variety with the Nagpuri language (also called Sadri), which is spoken in Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha by the Sadaan community. That is a completely separate language.</span></p>'),(3177,'<p class=\"c92\"><span class=\"c8\">The vocabulary of Nagpuri Marathi reflects the linguistic influences of the surrounding regions.

For example, in most varieties of Marathi, the word </span><span class=\"c10\">mi</span><span class=\"c11\"> is used for </span><span class=\"c10\">I</span><span class=\"c11\">, and </span><span class=\"c10\">tu</span><span class=\"c11\"> is used for </span><span class=\"c10\">you</span><span class=\"c8 c11\"> (singular). These are fairly common forms that do not have any endings added to them. However, in Nagpuri Marathi, speakers sometimes add endings to these pronouns, similar to the way Hindi speakers do.

In a sentence, the subject is the person or thing usually doing the action. In Marathi, when someone says </span><span class=\"c10\">I</span><span class=\"c11\"> (</span><span class=\"c10\">mi</span><span class=\"c11\">) or </span><span class=\"c10\">you</span><span class=\"c11\"> (</span><span class=\"c10\">tu</span><span class=\"c11\">), no extra endings are added to these pronouns, even in the past tense. But in Hindi, pronouns do change in certain tenses. For example, </span><span class=\"c10\">I</span><span class=\"c11\"> becomes </span><span class=\"c10\">mene</span><span class=\"c8 c11\"> when talking about a completed action.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c11\">In these cases, Nagpuri Marathi uses both systems. It can use </span><span class=\"c10\">mi</span><span class=\"c11\">, like in Marathi, or </span><span class=\"c10\">minə</span><span class=\"c11\">, </span><span class=\"c10\">myā</span><span class=\"c11\">, </span><span class=\"c10\">miyā</span><span class=\"c11\">, which are similar to Hindi’s </span><span class=\"c10\">mene</span><span class=\"c8 c11\">. This is another example of how Nagpuri Marathi follows Hindi patterns, especially in sentences about past actions. Here’s how this works in sentences:</span></p>\n<table class=\"c42\"><tr class=\"c14\"><td class=\"c17\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c23\"><span class=\"c26 c16 c11\">Sentence in Marathi</span></p></td><td class=\"c69\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c23\"><span class=\"c26 c16 c11\">Sentence in Nagpuri Marathi</span></p></td><td class=\"c71\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c23\"><span class=\"c26 c16 c11\">Hindi</span></p></td><td class=\"c34\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c23\"><span class=\"c26 c16 c11\">Meaning in English</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c19\"><td class=\"c17\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c15 c31\">Mi ek pustǝk vikǝt ghetlǝ.</span></p></td><td class=\"c69\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c15 c31\">Minǝ/mya/miya yek pustǝk gheun ghetlǝ.</span></p></td><td class=\"c71\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c15 c31\">Mene ek kitāb khǝrid li.</span></p></td><td class=\"c34\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">I bought a book.</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c19\"><td class=\"c17\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c15 c31\">Tu ek keɭ khāllǝ.</span></p></td><td class=\"c69\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c15 c31\">Tunǝ yek kel khāun rāhilā/rāhili.</span></p></td><td class=\"c71\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c15 c31\">Tune ek kelā khāyā.</span></p></td><td class=\"c34\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">I ate a banana.</span></p></td></tr></table>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c11\">In the first example, the Nagpuri Marathi sentence uses the word “gheun ghetlǝ”, which includes both the main verb (</span><span class=\"c10\">to take</span><span class=\"c11\">) and a helper verb, similar to the Hindi </span><span class=\"c10\">kharid li</span><span class=\"c11\">. In the second one, </span><span class=\"c10\">tunǝ</span><span class=\"c11\"> in Nagpuri Marathi acts like </span><span class=\"c10\">tune</span><span class=\"c8 c11\"> in Hindi, and again the sentence structure is closer to Hindi than to other types of Marathi.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c11\">Another small difference involves question words. In many Marathi-speaking areas, people ask </span><span class=\"c10\">why?</span><span class=\"c8 c11\"> using the word ka. In Nagpuri Marathi, however, kaun or kahun is used, which matches Hindi usage more closely. It’s a small shift, but it shows again how this variety of Marathi is shaped by contact with Hindi.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">Nagpuri Marathi also tends to choose different verbs compared to other varieties of Marathi, especially when talking about resting, getting angry, or being cold- a pattern that reflects its unique conjunction of verbs. Here are some examples:</span></p>\n<table class=\"c42\"><tr class=\"c14\"><td class=\"c34\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c23\"><span class=\"c26 c16 c11\">Marathi Words</span></p></td><td class=\"c34\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c23\"><span class=\"c26 c16 c11\">Nagpuri  Marathi</span></p></td><td class=\"c83\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c23\"><span class=\"c26 c16 c11\">Hindi</span></p></td><td class=\"c59\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c23\"><span class=\"c26 c16 c11\">Meaning in English</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c14\"><td class=\"c34\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c15 c31\">višrānti gheņe.</span></p></td><td class=\"c34\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c15 c31\">ārām karņe.</span></p></td><td class=\"c83\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c15 c31\">ārām karņā.</span></p></td><td class=\"c59\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">to take rest</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c14\"><td class=\"c34\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c15 c31\">rāg yeņe.</span></p></td><td class=\"c34\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c15 c31\">ghussā karņe.</span></p></td><td class=\"c83\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c15 c31\">gussā karņā.</span></p></td><td class=\"c59\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">to get angry</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c14\"><td class=\"c34\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c15 c31\">thandi asņe.</span></p></td><td class=\"c34\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c15 c31\">thaņdi padņe.</span></p></td><td class=\"c83\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c15 c31\">thaņd paŗņā.</span></p></td><td class=\"c59\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">To be cold outside.</span></p></td></tr></table>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">In these cases, Nagpuri Marathi uses the same verbs as Hindi, like ārām karṇe or ghussā karṇe, even though Marathi has its own words for these actions.

In Pune Marathi, an adverb is created by adding “-ne” to a noun. Hindi does something similar but uses “-se” instead. Nagpuri Marathi, however, has its own unique twist: it often takes a noun from Hindi and adds the Marathi instrumental suffix “-ne” to make an adverb.</span></p>\n<table class=\"c42\"><tr class=\"c14\"><td class=\"c20\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c23\"><span class=\"c26 c16 c11\">Marathi Words</span></p></td><td class=\"c34\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c23\"><span class=\"c16 c11 c26\">Nagpuri Marathi</span></p></td><td class=\"c59\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c23\"><span class=\"c26 c16 c11\">Hindi</span></p></td><td class=\"c59\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c23\"><span class=\"c26 c16 c11\">Meaning in English</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c14\"><td class=\"c20\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">sāvkāsh</span></p></td><td class=\"c34\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">ārāma-ne</span></p></td><td class=\"c59\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">ārām-se</span></p></td><td class=\"c59\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">slowly</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c14\"><td class=\"c20\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">kǝshṭā-ne</span></p></td><td class=\"c34\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">mushkili-ne</span></p></td><td class=\"c59\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">mushkil-se</span></p></td><td class=\"c59\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">With difficulty</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c14\"><td class=\"c20\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">ānǝndā-ne</span></p></td><td class=\"c34\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">khushi-ne</span></p></td><td class=\"c59\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">Khushi-se</span></p></td><td class=\"c59\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">Happily</span></p></td></tr></table>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">A progressive construction shows that an action is happening right now or was happening at a specific time, like saying something is in progress. In many varieties of Marathi, this is done by adding ‘-t’ to the verb stem and then using the appropriate form of the verb ‘asǝɳe’ (to be). Interestingly, Pune Marathi doesn\'t use the verb ‘rāhǝɳe’ (to live) for this purpose. In contrast, Hindi uses the verb ‘rāhɳe’ (to be) as a helping verb to indicate the progressive aspect.</span></p>\n<table class=\"c42\"><tr class=\"c14\"><td class=\"c34\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c26 c16 c11\">Marathi Words</span></p></td><td class=\"c79\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c26 c16 c11\">Nagpuri Marathi</span></p></td><td class=\"c72\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c26 c16 c11\">Hindi</span></p></td><td class=\"c61\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c26 c16 c11\">Gloss in English</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c19\"><td class=\"c34\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">Ti gāɳǝ mhǝɳǝt āhe.</span></p></td><td class=\"c79\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">Ti gāɳǝ mhaɳun rahili (āhe). </span></p></td><td class=\"c72\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">Voh gānā ga rǝhi hai.</span></p></td><td class=\"c61\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">She is singing a song.</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c19\"><td class=\"c34\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">Mulǝ kāmǝ  kǝrǝt āhet.</span></p></td><td class=\"c79\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">Mulǝ kāmǝ karun rāhili (ahet).</span></p></td><td class=\"c72\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">Lǝḍke kām kar rǝhe he.</span></p></td><td class=\"c61\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c24\"><span class=\"c8\">The boys are working.</span></p></td></tr></table>\n<p class=\"c88\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">In many variations of Marathi, the dative case (used for indirect objects) variations typically ends with -la or -s. However, Nagpuri Marathi allows for three possible endings: -le, -s, or -la. All of the following are grammatically acceptable:</span></p>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c10 c16\">Mi bhava</span><span class=\"c90 c10 c16\">la</span><span class=\"c10 c16\"> pani dile<br/>Mi bhava</span><span class=\"c10 c16 c90\">s </span><span class=\"c10 c16\">pani dile<br/>Mi bhava</span><span class=\"c90 c10 c16\">le </span><span class=\"c15 c10\">pani dile</span></p>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c16 c11\">All meaning: I gave water to my brother.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c11\">One of the most striking features of Nagpuri Marathi is its verb forms and sentence structure where speakers combine Marathi words with Hindi sentence patterns. In linguistics, this kind of mixing between two languages in a sentence or conversation is called code-mixing. In the case of Nagpuri Marathi, speakers often use Marathi vocabulary, but structure their sentences like Hindi. This code-mixing is not random — it follows regular patterns based on how both languages work.</span><span class=\"c8 c11\"> For example:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"c53 lst-kix_list_3-0 start\"><li class=\"c54 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">Pune Marathi: tu pustak ghe (You take the book)</span></li><li class=\"c9 c91 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">Hindi: tum kitab le lo</span></li><li class=\"c5 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">Nagpuri Marathi: tu pustak gheun ghena</span></li></ul>\n<p class=\"c13\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">This pattern of using a main verb + verb operator mirrors Hindi grammar. Nagpuri speakers may say:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"c53 lst-kix_list_1-0 start\"><li class=\"c9 c54 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">te pustak deun dena (Give that book)</span></li><li class=\"c5 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">tyala te mhanun dena (Say it to him)</span></li></ul>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c16 c11\">Such constructions will likely be considered ungrammatical in other forms of Marathi, which does not allow verb repetition in compound verbs, but they are completely natural in Hindi — and, by extension, in Nagpuri Marathi.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c8 c11\">One thing that stands out about Nagpuri Marathi is how its speakers use tenses. In most areas where Marathi is spoken, people usually talk in present tense or past tense. But in Nagpuri Marathi, people often speak in the present continuous or past continuous tense. For example, instead of saying “I ate,” someone might say “I was eating” even if they mean the same thing. This is similar to how people speak in Hindi.</span></p>'),(3183,'<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c8\">Varhadi is a language variety that is mainly spoken in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, in districts such as Amravati, Akola, Buldhana, Washim, and Yavatmal. This region is sometimes called ‘Varhad Pradesh’, as noted by Deepdhwaja Kosode (2017). The Vidarbha region has a long history, and is even mentioned in ancient texts like the Mahabharata as a legendary kingdom.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c8\">Varhadi is well known for a number of phonetic (sound) changes, differences in vocabulary, and grammatical features that make it distinct from other language varieties. </span></p>'),(3185,'<p class=\"c7\"><span>One of the most noticeable features of Varhadi is that the sound “ल” (la) is often replaced with “ड” (da). For example the word ‘बोल (bol)’ which means ‘</span><span class=\"c31\">to speak’ </span><span>becomes बोड (bod) in Varhadi. This change is quite common and perhaps gives Varhadi speech  a smoother and simpler sound in everyday use.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c8\">Another interesting feature, noted in the Amravati District Gazetteer (1968), is that long vowels, especially at the ends of words, are often shortened in Varhadi speech. This sound change perhaps makes words comparatively simpler and quicker to say. For example:</span></p>\n<table class=\"c42\"><tr class=\"c75\"><td class=\"c78\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c6 c38\"><span class=\"c28\">Varhadi Word</span></p></td><td class=\"c0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c6 c38\"><span class=\"c28\">Transliteration</span></p></td><td class=\"c66\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c6 c38\"><span class=\"c28\">English Meaning</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c75\"><td class=\"c78\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c7 c38\"><span>जोल</span></p></td><td class=\"c0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c7 c38\"><span class=\"c8\">jol</span></p></td><td class=\"c66\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c7 c38\"><span class=\"c8\">Near</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c75\"><td class=\"c78\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c7 c38\"><span>उडोला</span></p></td><td class=\"c0\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c7 c38\"><span class=\"c8\">udola</span></p></td><td class=\"c66\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c7 c38\"><span class=\"c8\">Squandered</span></p></td></tr></table>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span>These forms come from longer versions जवळ (javal) and उडविला (udavila), but the final vowels are shortened in daily speech.

Over time, this land has come under the rule of several dynasties, including the Satvahanas, Vakatakas, Silharas, Chalukyas, Kadambas, Yadavs, the Delhi Sultanate, Bahamanis, Adilshahi, the Marathas, and eventually the British. Each left behind traces of culture, custom, and language that continue to shape the district’s identity.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">Today, Marathi is the most widely spoken language in Ratnagiri, as recorded in the 2011 Census.

Having been shaped by a long history of contact with other languages and cultures, one of the most significant historical influences on Konkani came with the arrival of the Portuguese in Goa in the early 16th century.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">Their arrival resulted in the Goan Inquisition, where the Portuguese enforced Catholicism upon Goan society. As accounted by C. J. Costa (1977), “Imprisonment, torture, death penalties, and intimidating people into exile were used by the Inquisition to enforce Catholic religious control.” They also seized and burned books written in Konkani, as they were suspected of containing teachings that deviated from Catholic practices. This resulted in the exodus of people from Goa into neighbouring states such as Maharashtra, allowing the spread of Konkani beyond previous borders.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">The Portuguese are said to have forbidden the use of Konkani, mandating local people to speak Portuguese and be required to use it in all of their contacts. They imposed Konkani as the speech of the “uncultured”.

To quote Rocky Miranda, “Christians were more susceptible to Portuguese influence because of religious and cultural ties.” </span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">These variations tie mainly to the migration of Hindus from Goa to Maharashtra during the Portuguese rule due to fears of forced conversion and persecution. The Christian migration of Goans to Maharashtra occurred as many of them were heavily discriminated against, with the Portuguese often directing racial slurs and terming them as “inferiors.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">As a result of these migrations and differing colonial experiences, the Konkani spoken by Hindu and Christian communities began to diverge over time. While some differences are specific to religious practices and vocabulary, many others extend into everyday life. Words related to food, clothing, family, and education often reflect the influence of Portuguese on Christian Konkani.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">For example, a Hindu speaker might refer to a temple as “Devul” (देऊळ), a term shared with Marathi, whereas a Christian speaker would more likely use “igərdje”, which is influenced by the Portuguese word “igreja”. Similarly, the Hindu-speakers word for school, “Shāɭā” (षाळा), contrasts with the Christian variant “ishkol”, derived from the Portuguese “escola”. These examples highlight how religion-based communities within Konkani-speaking populations have developed different lexical preferences shaped by historical and cultural contact. It is important to note that these are general patterns rather than strict rules, and exceptions can be found in various speech communities.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">Another noticeable difference between the Hindu and Christian varieties of Konkani is the way the “h” sound is treated. In many words, the Christian variety tends to drop the “h” sound, while the Hindu variety keeps it. This may be due to the influence of Portuguese, which doesn’t use aspirated sounds (sounds made with a strong burst of breath, like bh, gh, or kh), unlike many Indian languages.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">In several cases, aspirated consonants are simplified in the Christian variety. For example, the word भुर्गो (bhurgə, meaning \"boy\") becomes बूगो॔ (burgə), with the aspirated bh sound simplified to a plain b. Likewise, घोऊ (ghou, \"husband\") becomes गोऊ (gou), and खोप्टि (khopti, \"hut\") becomes होप्टि (hopti), showing a similar softening of the initial consonant.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">In other cases, the “h” sound is dropped when it appears after a vowel, that is, when the syllable before it ends in a vowel. For instance, the word हांडी (handi, meaning \"pot\") becomes आंडी (andi) in the Christian variant. The “h” sound is removed. This kind of change tends to make the word flow more easily, especially when spoken quickly.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">These changes are not universal, but they occur frequently enough to be considered common features of Christian Konkani. The following table shows a few examples of these variations:</span></p>\n<table class=\"c21\"><tr class=\"c22\"><td class=\"c7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c26\"><span class=\"c13 c6\">Hindu Variant Words</span></p></td><td class=\"c7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c26\"><span class=\"c13 c6\">Christian Variant Equivalent</span></p></td><td class=\"c7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c26\"><span class=\"c13 c6\">English Meaning</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c48\"><td class=\"c7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c9\"><span>भुर्गो (B</span><span class=\"c11\">h</span><span class=\"c1\">urgə)</span></p></td><td class=\"c7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c1\">बूगो॔ (Burgə)</span></p></td><td class=\"c7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c1\">Boy</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c22\"><td class=\"c7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c9\"><span>घोऊ (G</span><span class=\"c11\">h</span><span class=\"c1\">ou)</span></p></td><td class=\"c7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c1\">गोऊ (Gou)</span></p></td><td class=\"c7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c1\">Husband</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c22\"><td class=\"c7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c9\"><span>खोप्टि (K</span><span class=\"c11\">h</span><span class=\"c1\">opti)</span></p></td><td class=\"c7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c1\">होप्टि (Hopti)</span></p></td><td class=\"c7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c1\">Hut</span></p></td></tr></table>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c6\">Another interesting difference between the Hindu and Christian varieties of Konkani is the use of the sound “ळ” (</span><span class=\"c6 c20\">ɭ</span><span class=\"c6\">), which is written as “ळ” in the Devanagari script. This is a special kind of “L” sound categorized by linguists as a retroflex lateral (where the tongue curls back slightly). The sound is, notably, not found in most Indo-Aryan languages but is common in Konkani and Marathi. Linguists like Dhondge and Wali (2009) suggest that this sound may have come into the language through contact with South Indian (Dravidian) languages, where it is more common.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c6\">In the Christian variety of Konkani, this sound is often not used. Instead, speakers usually replace it with a simpler “ल” (</span><span class=\"c6 c20\">l</span><span class=\"c6\">) sound or something similar. This change, Vivek Bhat (2019) suggests may be influenced by Portuguese, which doesn’t have the “ळ” sound.

It is spoken in towns around Belagavi, Dodamarg, Sawantwadi, and parts of southern Ajara taluka. Chandgadi is a taluka located adjacent to Goa on one side and about 15 km from Belagavi in Karnataka on the other. Its geographical position, near both Konkani and Kannada-speaking regions, has significantly influenced its development. Within the region, it is referred to as Chandgadi Boli, and variations in speech can be observed depending on proximity to these linguistic boundaries. While the variety does not have its own written script, Nandkumar More (2017) mentions that women in the region sing many folk songs in Changadi which they call ‘gittis.’ </span></p>'),(3242,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">According to Nandkumar More (2017), while Chandgadi is closely related to Marathi, it has distinct grammatical features and unique pronunciation patterns. According to Nandkumar More (2017), one of its most noticeable features lies in its distinctive “accent” and “prolongation of terminal sounds”.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">Chandgadi speakers structure their sentences differently from how they would be spoken in Marathi or other related languages. For example, the phrase \"Are you going?\" is spoken as \"jAUlesAya,\" which, despite being a complete sentence, sounds like a single continuous word. This sentence is actually made up of multiple parts such as jA (go), U (a stretched vowel sound), les (part of the verb structure), Aya (question marker or suffix). However, instead of distinct pauses between words, Chandgadi speech merges sounds together, making entire phrases feel like a single unit. This effect comes from the “draggin” or what linguists might call the elongation of vowel sounds, particularly in \"U,\" \"sA,\" and \"ya,\" giving the speech a smooth, flowing quality.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span>Certain words in Chandgadi also have distinct pronunciation patterns, as seen in the table below:</span></p>\n<table class=\"c21\"><tr class=\"c59\"><td class=\"c51\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c15\"><span class=\"c6 c18\">Chandgadi Word</span></p></td><td class=\"c41\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c15\"><span class=\"c6 c18\">Phonetic Transcription</span></p></td><td class=\"c39\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c15\"><span class=\"c6 c18\">Meaning in English</span></p></td><td class=\"c61\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c15\"><span class=\"c6 c18\">Comparison with Marathi</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c40\"><td class=\"c51\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c6\">सोमार (</span><span class=\"c6 c20\">somar</span><span class=\"c1\">)</span></p></td><td class=\"c41\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">/somar/</span></p></td><td class=\"c39\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">Monday</span></p></td><td class=\"c61\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c6\">Marathi: </span><span class=\"c6 c20\">सोमवार</span><span class=\"c1\"> (somvar)</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c40\"><td class=\"c51\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c6\">इस (</span><span class=\"c6 c20\">i:s</span><span class=\"c1\">)</span></p></td><td class=\"c41\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">/i:s/</span></p></td><td class=\"c39\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">Twenty</span></p></td><td class=\"c61\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c6\">Marathi: </span><span class=\"c6 c20\">वीस</span><span class=\"c1\"> (vis)</span></p></td></tr></table>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">These examples show vowel shifts and how sounds have been simplified in this variety.

For instance, even though packaged masalas are now found in the market, people use “Khade Masalas” or whole spices instead of buying from the market. </span></p>'),(3387,'<p class=\"c10\"><span class=\"c1\">Oil plays an important role in Indian cooking, as almost every type of curry begins with frying onions in some kind of oil. In the past, black til (sesame) oil was commonly used in households, but now people choose from a wide range of oils available in the market. </span></p>'),(3389,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">Another significant change has occurred in the methods and utensils used for cooking. Previously, meals were prepared on a mud stove known as a chula. However, due to economic development, this practice has diminished, and cooking gas stoves are now found in most households that can afford a gas connection. It is noteworthy that mud stoves are still present in many homes but are now limited to cooking certain dishes. Additionally, cooking utensils that were once made of aluminum have largely been replaced by stainless steel. Some implements, such as the “kavil” and “kadhai,” are made from a specific type of material known as “bhida”.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">Traditionally, Kharwas were distributed among the villagers to announce that the distributor\'s cow had given birth. These milk-related dishes were enjoyed throughout the village. Fresh dahi (curd) was eaten with rice or on its own. However, these practices seem to have diminished as cow rearing has somewhat declined.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">Among all the changes that have taken place in food culture, one thing that has remained constant is people’s love for buttermilk. In earlier times, cow milk was used to make dahi, Taak (buttermilk), Kharwas (made from the first milk a cow gives after giving birth), and other dishes. Taak was an important part of people’s diets and is still consumed today, although not on a daily basis.</span></p>'),(3391,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">Since Ratnagiri is a coastal district, seafood is undoubtedly extremely prevalent. Earlier, the Brahmin community used to refrain from eating non-vegetarian food, but this has now changed. The exceptions to this culture are the bhakts of Vitthal Bhagwan, known as Buas and Buins, who have accepted the Tulsi mala. They only consume vegetarian food and also refrain from alcohol. Lastly, people avoid eating non-vegetarian food during the Shravan month (August-September).</span></p>'),(3393,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">People usually have three meals a day: breakfast</span><span>, </span><span class=\"c2\">lunch</span><span>, </span><span class=\"c2\">and dinner. Lunch and dinner typically consist of various types of leafy vegetables, such as methi, tera, and mathh, as well as seafood items like kolambi (prawns), moshi, and sukat (dry fish). In between lunch and dinner, people often take a tea break, which is usually accompanied by snacks such as fried fish, karanjis, shankarpali, bha</span><span>j</span><span class=\"c1\">jis, and vadas.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">In the past, people primarily consumed only supari as a digestive. However, nowadays, many have started eating fennel seeds and fruits such as watermelons, melons, and mangoes (in summer). Additionally, people enjoy sweet dried amla. Many also drink solkadhi, made from kokum and coconut milk, or kokam sarbat.</span></p>'),(3397,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">The food in Ratnagiri is not very spicy. Dry coconut is roasted and used in making garam masala, which is added to every curry. This process helps to reduce the spice levels of the food consumed. Adding coconut milk to the curry is another method for balancing the spice level. </span></p>'),(3399,'<p class=\"c10\"><span class=\"c1\">One thing Ratnagiri is known for is its mangoes, especially Alphonso mangoes, which are called Hapus in Marathi. There is a distinction among these mangoes as well: mangoes found in the wild are called Raivali, while Alphonso mangoes grown by grafting are referred to as Kalmi. Alphonso mangoes are typically eaten fresh, while other types of wild mangoes are used in various dishes such as Aampoli and Muramba. Raw wild mangoes are made into lonche (pickles), aamsall, and chutneys.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c10\"><span class=\"c1\">Additionally, other fruits such as kaju (cashew nuts), phanas (jackfruit), kokum, and coconut are also locally grown and consumed. Local fruits like jambhul, kokam, star fruit, and jackfruit are nature\'s offerings that should not be missed.</span></p>'),(3402,'<p class=\"c10\"><span class=\"c2\">The main foods that were grown and traded have remained somewhat the same, with fruits being added to the range of crops cultivated, while the production of items like supari (betel nut) has declined. In the past, rice, mangoes, cashew nuts, betel nuts, jackfruit, coconuts, and, to some extent, bananas were traded. Now, there is a greater emphasis on horticulture; people have started growing and consuming fruits like chikoos, watermelons, and pineapples. Other fruits are also now widely consumed and used in religious offerings. </span></p>'),(3405,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">The people of Ratnagiri love their pickles. Usually, they use raw mango, lemon, and fish to make them. Sometimes, green chilies are also added to the mix.</span></p>'),(3407,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">Newborn babies are fed cow\'s milk for the first three days or until the mother can nurse the baby. Thereafter, for the next three months, finely ground rice flour is mixed with milk and fed to the baby in addition to mothers nursing the baby. This appears to be the common practice across every community in the district.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">For school-going children, parents usually pack items such as bhaaji and chapati in their tiffins. Finally, government schools in Ratnagiri serve mid-day meals such as khichdi and rice-dal.</span></p>'),(3410,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Like most other districts, the food palate of Ratnagiri changes with the seasons. For example, during the monsoon, fish and crabs found in the paddy fields are widely consumed. Additionally, certain delicacies are specially prepared for specific festivals. For instance, Modaks are made during Ganpati, and Puran Polis are prepared for Holi and Gudi Padwa. </span><span>Interestingly, on </span><span class=\"c2\">the day of Gauri\'s arrival (</span><span>during Ganesh Chaturthi</span><span class=\"c2\">), vade with chicken is made. During Diwali, various types of snacks are prepared at home. An offering of </span><span>K</span><span class=\"c2\">heer and </span><span>G</span><span class=\"c2\">havane is also made to the Gram Devta during Holi.</span></p>'),(3412,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Usually, the food at weddings is vegetarian. Curries of Brinjal, Panner, Potato, and Kabuli Chana are usually served with Puris. Papads, Koshimbir, and a pickle are given as sides. Rice and dal are common. For deserts, Gulab </span><span>Ja</span><span class=\"c2\">mun, Jalebis, Rasgulla, or </span><span>small pieces </span><span class=\"c1\">of Puran Poli are usually served.</span></p>'),(3414,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Kandi Pedha, along with other types of </span><span>P</span><span class=\"c2\">edhas, </span><span>M</span><span class=\"c2\">otichoor </span><span>L</span><span class=\"c2\">adoo, and </span><span>K</span><span class=\"c2\">hadi </span><span>S</span><span class=\"c1\">akhar, are some of the prasads offered at mandirs across the district.</span></p>'),(3416,'<p class=\"c10\"><span class=\"c1\">Community lunches and dinners known as Bhandara are common during religious occasions. Festivals such as Hanuman Jayanti, Navratri, and Mahashivratri are always followed by a “Mahaprasad.” People are also expected to host community lunches or dinners when they conduct any puja at home. These meals are typically prepared by the women of the village who come together to cook.</span></p>'),(3418,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">When it comes to drinking alcohol and smoking, there is a stark gender difference. Alcohol is primarily consumed by men, who are also the ones most likely to smoke. Data suggests that 13% of men in Ratnagiri consume alcohol, compared to only 0.5% of women. Alcohol is often perceived as something that only men are permitted to consume, leading women to refrain from drinking. Men typically drink during social gatherings, although public drinking is still frowned upon. A local variety of alcohol known as ‘Madi’ is made by fermenting the extract of coconut trees for a day. In Ratnagiri, there is a particular community that completely abstains from alcohol; these individuals have accepted the “Tulsi Mala”.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">Regarding smoking, people tend to prefer ‘bidis’ over modern cigarettes. In addition to smoking, many also chew tobacco products such as “Masheri”. According to the NFHS report from 2019-2020, approximately 18.4% of women use some form of tobacco, while around 31.3% of men do the same. This gender disparity can be attributed to the fact that only older women are generally seen consuming tobacco (in the form of paan or supari), while younger women tend to avoid such products altogether. </span></p>'),(3420,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">There are many popular dishes, such as </span><span>G</span><span class=\"c2\">havane and </span><span>M</span><span class=\"c2\">uramba, that are </span><span>local </span><span class=\"c2\">to Ratnagiri. Additionally, rice is a significant component of Ratnagiri’s cuisine. It is widely grown for both subsistence and commercial purposes, making it a staple in nearly every household. Rice is ground on a jata into rice flour, which is used for making bhakris, modaks, and other dishes. Whole uncooked rice is made into a paste using a pata &amp; varvanta for dishes like </span><span>Ghavane</span><span class=\"c1\">. Another irreplaceable component of Ratnagiri’s food is coconut, which serves as the base for most curry dishes.</span></p>'),(3422,'<p class=\"c28\"><span class=\"c2\">Most of these dishes have variations in how they are made. For example, some people prefer Ghavanes that are a bit sour in taste (called </span><span>A</span><span class=\"c2\">mbole). Usually, the batter for </span><span>G</span><span class=\"c2\">havane is freshly prepared by grinding whole, wet, uncooked rice grains. To make Amboles, one needs to grind and add methi, dhan</span><span>a</span><span class=\"c1\"> (whole coriander seeds), and chana dal to the rice batter. Then, it should be left overnight to ferment and cooked the next morning.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Another dish that has some variation in its preparation is </span><span>M</span><span class=\"c1\">uramba. People usually fry rai (mustard seeds) with jeera (cumin seeds) and then add diced raw mango along with some red chili powder and jaggery. In other regions, people prefer not to include mustard seeds and jeera.</span></p>'),(3424,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">Vades are also made in different ways at places. Nowadays, people like adding cucumbers or other such vegetables to the batter made out of rice flour, fennel seeds, black paper, chana dal, jaggery, and urad dal with some salt. </span></p>'),(3427,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">The batter should be set aside for a while before being deep-fried, preferably over a mud stove. In the past, the batter was flattened on a banana leaf, but now rough plastic is used instead. Jackfruit seeds are dried in the sun and then used in fish curries. The \"male flower\" part of the banana is also cooked. Dried fish is another dish that can be prepared in several ways. </span></p>'),(3429,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">When it comes to sweets, Ratnagiri boasts a rich variety. Modaks, Karanjis, Pedas, and Purans are extremely popular in the district. One particularly unique dish is called \"Bors,\" made from rice flour and jaggery syrup.</span></p>'),(3431,'<p class=\"c15\"><span class=\"c2 c21\">&lt;insert restaurants map&gt;</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">The culture of eating out has gained immense popularity over the past few decades, with numerous eateries opening in towns offering a variety of dishes such as Pav Bhaji, Pani Puri, Dabeli, and Dosas. In earlier times, street food options were largely limited to various types of Bhajjis (fritters) and Vada Pav. Nowadays, families frequently dine out for special occasions like birthdays and anniversaries. Food also plays a significant role in community building, particularly in places like Ratnagiri.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c1\">The trend of dining out appears to be particularly strong among the younger generation, with diverse eateries sprouting up at every corner. Additionally, there has been a noticeable rise in restaurants serving Chinese cuisine. While older and middle-aged individuals tend to dine out primarily during wedding functions or community dinners, younger people are more inclined to enjoy street food regularly.</span></p>'),(3433,'<p class=\"c0\"><span>The Adarsh Upahar Gruh has been in existence for 75 years, as of 10 </span><span>May 2024.

In 1947, the restaurant began by selling only Bhajis, Vadas, and Chai; now it sells Dosas, Pav Bhaji, and other lunch items and homemade sweets.

Like many ancient art forms, the petroglyphs of Ratnagiri remain largely mysterious, with little known about their creators, purpose, or the stories attached to them. </span></p>\n<p class=\"c41\"><span class=\"c6\">Estimates suggest that these petroglyphs are between 10,000 and 12,000 years old, placing them in the Mesolithic period (a transitional era between nomadic hunting and early settled life). Surprisingly, however, the first recorded discovery of a petroglyph in the area was near Ratnagiri </span><span>c</span><span class=\"c6\">ity, in the village of Niwali, during the 1980s. However, systematic documentation by the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums, Maharashtra, began very recently. By January 2019, it has been noted that over 1,000 petroglyphs had been documented across 52 sites in the region.</span></p>'),(3584,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">The carvings depict a variety of subjects, including static human figures, large mammals like elephants and tigers, aquatic life such as sharks and dolphins, and birds like peacocks and egrets. Some animals are unidentifiable, possibly representing extinct or symbolic species. Notably, a petroglyph of a rhinoceros (a species not typically associated with the region) has been found.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">In addition to these figures, the petroglyphs feature intricate geometric and abstract patterns composed of circular, oval, or rectangular shapes with complex internal designs. Scholars believe these designs were intentional and may have held ritualistic or symbolic significance. The effort required to carve into laterite rock with primitive tools suggests a deliberate and communal process, possibly indicating that these carvings were created by organized communities rather than isolated individuals.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Despite their historical importance, the petroglyphs face several threats. Locals say that urban development, mining, and construction activities—particularly due to the widespread use of laterite in buildings—have already led to the destruction of some sites. Many carvings are located on private land, where property owners may conceal or damage them due to fears of government intervention or land acquisition.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Awareness of these prehistoric carvings has grown in recent years.

A dedicated research and documentation center has also been established in Ratnagiri to study and preserve these carvings.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">While most people today may feel little connection to these ancient markings, efforts are underway to bridge that gap—linking early human creativity with contemporary understanding to ensure this heritage is not lost.</span></p>'),(3586,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Naman is a form of theatrical performance which involves music, dance, and storytelling. The story of the musical is of ‘epic proportions;’ for it often features supernatural elements, lofty themes, and ample settings that are the typical characteristics of the epic genre. Like many traditional art forms in India, the exact origins of the musical are difficult to trace. However, what is known about its history is that it was originally known as Khele (खेळे) and emerged as a form of rural entertainment for the farmers of the Konkan region. </span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span>The art form can be commonly found in different parts of the Konkan region.

In Sindhudurg, it is better known as Dashavtar, though the performance structure and themes remain closely related across regions.</span></p>'),(3588,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Every Naman performance begins with a Ganpati Puja, seeking blessings for a smooth and successful presentation. The performances generally fall into two narrative types namely, “Gan” where episodes are centered on Ganpati, or stories from the Ramayan and Mahabharat. The other is “Gavlan”, where tales from Krishna Leela, such as the slaying of Kalia, Draupadi\'s Vastraharan, or Devaki’s wedding are enacted. These narratives are often drawn from Puranic literature and epics but may be adapted by the Shahir (writer-director) for comedic or satirical effect.</span></p>'),(3593,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c6\">Historically, Naman was performed exclusively by men. Due to social norms, women were not permitted on stage; instead, male performers would portray female roles, wearing sar</span><span>ee</span><span class=\"c6\">s and ornaments with minimal makeup—typically kajal and a red dot.

Today, however, it is carried out by professional artists who have formed Naman Pathaks (groups). These groups now perform throughout the year in various villages, often on special occasions such as the consecration of a newly built Mandir or a Satyanarayan puja.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">However, the art form faces mounting challenges. Many artists talk about how modern audiences often favor DJs and orchestras, sidelining traditional theatre. In some cases, performances have leaned toward crude humor or vulgarity, deviating from their original epic and moral focus. Many Shahirs—once central to the creative process, have migrated to cities like Mumbai or Pune, leaving some groups without strong leadership. Performers also face financial instability, lack of social respect, and disruptive audiences. As a result, some have chosen to abandon the tradition altogether. </span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c9 c6 c25\">Yet, despite these challenges, many performers remain deeply committed to Naman. They continue to preserve its storytelling traditions, mentor younger artists, and adapt where needed without losing the form’s core.

This dance was known as Jakadi or Chavli Naach. With the migration of Kokani people to Mumbai, it became known as Balya Naach.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2 c9\">Over time, artists say not only has the name changed, but so have the participants and instruments. While initially performed exclusively by men, women also take part in some places now. The musical instruments have evolved as well; modern performances often incorporate sound systems and smaller dhols alongside traditional Dholkis, Taals, and Jhanj. </span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2 c9\">During the performance, dancers move in a circle while singers and instrumentalists remain seated inside the circle. The initial songs praised Ganpati, the muse and deva of the art, who is prayed to  before any auspicious events in local households. Subsequently, the songs shift to mythological themes, telling stories from the Mahabharat, Ramayan, and Krishna Leela. Popular stories include those of Shravan, Sita-Haran, and Krishna\'s playful mischief with the gopis in Vrindavan. </span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2 c9\">A crucial element of Jakadi, similar to Naman, is the role of the Shahirs. Shahirs serve as composers, lyricists, singers, and sometimes instrumentalists, making them the backbone of Kokan\'s performance arts. They are expected to be deeply religious and well-versed in Hindu religious texts, as they significantly contribute to the performance.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2 c9\">Many district-level competitions have emerged, where groups (pathaks) from various parts of Ratnagiri—often consisting of members from a particular village—compete and win accolades and prizes. Similar competitions are also held for Naman performances.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c9 c6\">However, some believe that Jakadi has lost some of its authenticity over time. With many Shahirs migrating out of the district and teenagers losing interest, Jakadi now appears to be more of a ritual performed during Ganpati rather than a lively art form meant for communal enjoyment and togetherness.</span></p>'),(3612,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Katkhel is a local folk art performance prevalent in the Dapoli region of Konkan.

Sigfried Giedion, an art historian and one of the most influential thinkers in modern architectural theory, writes in Space, Time and Architecture (1941) that architecture is “so bound up with the life of a period as a whole” that it inevitably reveals how societies function and evolve. Buildings are not just the backdrop to human life; they are part of how society works, remembers, and changes. They hold meaning, in many ways, not only because of who built them or when, but because of how people have used and lived with them over time.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c3\">In Ratnagiri, architecture has served as both a witness to and participant in historical change. The district’s built landscape tells the story of shifting power, belief, and identity. Each structure carries traces of the time it was built, the people who shaped it, and the communities that gave it purpose.</span></p>'),(3665,'<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Ratnagiri’s architecture reflects a confluence of trade and layered religious traditions shaped by its coastal geography. The rock-cut Panhalakaji Caves in Dapoli trace over a millennium of Buddhist, Shaiva, and Nath sect patronage carved into laterite cliffs. Coastal forts like Gopalgad and Bankot, first built under the Adil Shahis and Shilaharas, and later adapted by the Marathas and British, reflect shifting political control along maritime trade routes. Early Deccan mandirs such as Karneshwar Mandir feature basalt structures with iconographic variations, while the Murlidhar Mandir showcases localized adaptations to the Konkan climate. Sites like Parshuram Mandir exhibit syncretic styles blending Hindu, Portuguese, and Islamic elements, while Shahi Masjid in Dabhol shows Iranian influence with its egg-shaped dome. Thiba Palace, built in exile for Burma’s last king, blends colonial and Burmese architectural elements in laterite and teak.</span></p>'),(3667,'<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c3\">Panhalakaji Caves represent a multi-religious rock-cut architectural tradition carved into laterite cliffs along the Kotjai River in Ratnagiri district.

Later caves show Vajrayana influences and the presence of inscriptions in Brahmi and later Devanagari scripts further marks the site\'s evolving chronology.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c3\">From the 8th century onwards, during the Shilahara rule, several caves were modified or newly excavated for Shaiva and Nath Panth (Nath Panth, or Nath Sampradaya, is a South Asian religious order primarily found associated with ascetic practices and yoga) use. Cave 14 features images of Nath figures like Matsyendranath and Gorakhnath. Cave 29, known locally as Gaur Lena, was associated with Nath ascetic practice. It houses a stone Shivling and contains Shaiva motifs on the ceiling.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c3\">The caves are hewn primarily into laterite rock and feature flat ceilings, plain columns, and occasionally carved door frames or iconographic panels.

The fort was known as Himmatgad under the Marathas and Fort Victoria under the British, reflecting its shifts in political control. The origins of Bankot Fort are believed to date back to the Shilahara dynasty (around the 10th to 13th Century), although the earliest documented reference appears in 1548, when the Portuguese are said to have captured and set fire to the fort and surrounding village.</span></p>'),(3674,'<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c3\">The fort’s layout is built for defense, featuring laterite walls around three ft. thick and a wide trench surrounding the structure. The main gate still stands, with remnants of a carved Bhagwaan Ganesh visible on the stone, a trace of the fort’s Maratha heritage. Within the compound are the remains of British-era bungalows, a well to the west, and a memorial to the wife and daughter of Officer Arthur Malt, who drowned at Bankot Khadi. A concealed sea-facing passage, known as the Chor Darwaja, may have been used for escape or discreet movement.</span></p>'),(3676,'<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c3\">Karneshwar Mandir is a stone-built structure reflecting early medieval Deccan mandir architecture. Located at the confluence of the Shashtri and Sonavani rivers in Kasba, Ratnagiri, it is dedicated to Bhagwaan Shiv and is among the oldest surviving mandirs in the region. Its construction is generally attributed to King Karn of the 11th-century Chalukya dynasty and is now a state-protected monument.</span></p>'),(3678,'<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c3\">The Mandir is built primarily from dark basalt stone and features a sabhamandap (assembly hall) and mukhmandap (entrance hall), with stone carvings that reflect stylistic elements of medieval Indian iconography.</span></p>'),(3680,'<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c22\">A prominent sculptural panel above the sabhamandap entrance shows Bhagwaan Vishnu in a reclining posture beneath a frieze of the Dashavatars.

Located near Anjanvel village in Ratnagiri, the fort dates back to the 16th century, originally constructed under the Adil Shahi dynasty of Bijapur. It occupies a strategic position at the junction of the Vashishti River, Dabhol Creek, and the Arabian Sea, overlooking maritime routes and trade points on the western coast.</span></p>'),(3689,'<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c3\">The fort is enclosed by laterite walls and features two main gates—an eastern gate bearing a Farsi inscription dated 1707, and a western gate facing the sea. Defensive features include a trench cut into the southern side of the fort and bastions positioned to guard against coastal attacks. The layout suggests a combination of residential and military functions, with the remains of a wada-style structure likely used for administrative or domestic purposes. The open courtyards and platform bases inside the fort indicate spaces for troop movement or temporary encampments.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c3\">Although now partially ruined, the surviving walls and foundation lines offer insight into typical Konkan coastal fort design, emphasizing visibility, access to water routes, and fortification against siege.</span></p>'),(3691,'<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c3\">Shahi Masjid in Dabhol follows Iranian architectural influence and was built in the 16th century.

Its entrance includes a fountain and ablution basin. The facade features three large arches and four minarets placed at each corner. These minarets are simple but finely carved. The dome rises to a height of approximately 75 ft. and was once covered in gold leaf. Notably, the masjid has a central chhatri in front of the main dome and a symmetrical layout typical of Iranian-style masjids.</span></p>'),(3695,'<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c3\">Parshuram Mandir in Chiplun follows a syncretic architectural style, combining Hindu, Portuguese, and Islamic influences. Located near the Mumbai–Goa Highway in Ratnagiri district, the Mandir was established around 1710 by Paramhans Shri Guru Bhramendra Swami. It is dedicated to Parshuram, the sixth form of Bhagwaan Vishnu, who is believed—according to regional lore—to have created the Konkan coast. The site holds deep religious and cultural significance. The Mandir’s architectural history is shaped by overlapping moments of regional patronage, Maratha associations, and reconstruction involving Portuguese artisans. </span></p>'),(3697,'<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c3\">Architecturally, the Mandir displays a mix of styles. The black stone structure includes a laterite base, ornamental arches, and a modest shikhara (spire). The garbhagriha houses the murti of Parshuram, while smaller devasthans are found within the complex. The presence of features such as cusped arches and plaster detailing reflects Portuguese and Islamic stylistic elements layered onto a Hindu mandir plan.</span></p>'),(3700,'<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c3\">The Mandir is located on the banks of the Vashishti River, offering a scenic view of the river and hills.

Though modest in scale, the structure offers insight into the spatial and material traditions of its time and continues to function as a site of regular worship.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c3\">The Mandir is approached by a short flight of stairs leading into a wooden sabhamandap, which is supported by carved wooden pillars and topped with a sloping roof made of mud tiles. The use of wood and tiles is typical of mandir construction in Konkan’s humid coastal climate, where lighter materials and sloped roofing help manage rainfall and humidity.</span></p>'),(3704,'<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c3\">A stone deepmal (lamp tower) stands in the courtyard, lit during festive occasions.

It was constructed in 1910 as the residence of Thibaw Min, the last king of Burma, who was exiled and placed under house arrest here by the British. His queen, Supayalat, also lived at the site until his death in 1916.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c3\">Thiba Palace is built from red laterite and features a symmetrical three-storeyed layout. The structure includes teakwood beams, lava stone walls, and an exposed wooden roof. A central courtyard with a water fountain improves ventilation and reflects typical colonial design.</span></p>'),(3708,'<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c3\">Key architectural details include semicircular wooden windows inspired by Burmese stupas, arched openings for lighting and airflow, and a marble-floored hall used for performances. Peripheral corridors and a concealed staircase used by the royal family are also part of the layout. A Buddhist murti placed at the rear adds to the palace’s Burmese architectural elements.</span></p>'),(3710,'<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Homes are spaces we occupy daily, yet few reflect on how they are built or the stories embedded within them. While monumental structures capture the grandeur of dynasties and broader societal patterns across eras; domestic spaces, such as one’s house, arguably, preserve the subtler ways in which culture and history have shaped everyday life through generations. Architectural theorist Amos Rapoport explores this aspect of domestic spaces in his book, House, Form, and Culture (1969), noting, “The house is an institution...influenced by the cultural milieu to which it belongs.” Thus, residential spaces become archives, shaped by the values, needs, and traditions of their inhabitants.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c7\"><span class=\"c22\">In Ratnagiri district, domestic architecture reflects a deep-rooted engagement with time—both seasonal and historical. Residences across the region, from the 1940s Konkani homes to mid-20th century structures in Chiplun, are shaped by agricultural rhythms, climatic needs, and evolving social norms. These houses often feature sloping roofs with terracotta or mud tiles, stone or laterite plinths, and mud-plastered walls—all drawing on local materials for thermal comfort and durability. Spatial arrangements, such as the presence of a vadi for cultivation or an attic for grain storage, show how households integrated food production into the very fabric of daily life. Elements like the </span><span class=\"c20\">balintinichi kholi</span><span class=\"c3\"> (a dedicated room for menstruating or pregnant women), clerestory windows, and inward-opening shutters offer insights into how domestic spaces adapted over time to both private rituals and communal exchanges. With renovations spanning decades, these homes embody not just continuity, but the layering of lived experiences—reimagining time through material memory and incremental change.</span></p>'),(3712,'<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Ratnagiri district is home to several settlements where built structures are closely integrated with agricultural practices and the natural landscape. In one such settlement, this one-storey residence, built around the mid-1940s, sits at the centre of a rectangular plot. The front yard features flowering shrubs and seasonal vegetables, while the backyard—locally known as the vadi—is used for cultivating coconuts, supari, and beans. Most houses in the area have a well in their vadi, supplying fresh water for domestic use. The village streets, locally referred to as chirache raste, are traditionally paved with laterite red stones, lending a distinct visual and cultural identity to the settlement.</span></p>'),(3714,'<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">The plinth of the house is built using stone masonry. The composite structure features locally available materials—cow dung was traditionally used to coat the floor, while the walls are constructed with red sandstone and finished with a layer of red mud plaster. Red sandstone was chosen for its thermal properties, helping to keep the house cool. The sloping roof is covered with terracotta tiles, which also aid in temperature regulation. </span></p>'),(3716,'<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">The doors of the house are made out of wood.

There, he was entrusted by Gandhi with the responsibility of publishing the weekly journal Young India.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c9\">Patwardhan\'s commitment to the freedom struggle led to his imprisonment for three and a half years due to his participation in the Satyagraha movement.

He broke caste barriers by engaging in manual scavenging himself and producing manure (Sonkhat) at the ashram. Defying societal norms, he and his upper-caste colleagues even skinned dead animals to make leather, a task traditionally restricted to the Mahar caste.

Beginning his political career as a shakha pramukh (local ward chief) in the Shiv Sena, Rane steadily rose through the party ranks, eventually becoming Chief Minister of Maharashtra in 1999 during the final phase of the Shiv Sena–BJP government. His appointment, replacing Manohar Joshi, was a strategic move by Bal Thackeray, who viewed Rane as a strong Maratha leader capable of consolidating the party’s base ahead of the assembly elections.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c9\">Rane’s political journey, however, has also been marked by sharp turns.

It is home to ancient petroglyphs, prehistoric rock carvings, that offer rare insight into early human life on the western coast of India. Over time, the district came under the rule of major dynasties, who each have left an everlasting mark on the district&rsquo;s cultural heritage and governance. </span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">This district is home to Dabhol port, which has held a prominent position since ancient times as a major center of trade. It attracted merchants and travelers from distant lands and played a role in the spread of Buddhist ideologies beyond India. Its strategic coastal location facilitated maritime trade routes, which in many ways, contributed to the district&rsquo;s prosperity. During the colonial period, Ratnagiri remained under British rule for over two centuries and played a role in the freedom struggle. It was the birthplace of Lokmanya Tilak and a center of influence for leaders like Gopal Krishna Gokhale. For much of its modern administrative history, Ratnagiri included what is now Sindhudurg district. In 1981, the region was reorganized and Sindhudurg was carved out as a separate district, which in turn, shaped the present boundaries of Ratnagiri.</span></p>'),(3919,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">One of the earliest traces of human presence in Ratnagiri district comes from its petroglyphs, which are prehistoric rock carvings that are etched into the laterite surfaces of the Konkan plateau. These carvings, often created by chiseling into stone or arranging rock fragments to form shapes, are believed to date back to the Mesolithic period, roughly 10,000 to 12,000 years ago.</span></p>'),(3921,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">While petroglyphs are found across parts of India, the Konkan region has one of the highest concentrations. Within this zone, Ratnagiri stands out for the number and diversity of sites. Villages like Devihasol and Barsu in Rajapur taluka, and Ukshi in Ratnagiri taluka, are among some of the key sites where these carvings have been discovered with many of them being estimated to be around 10,000 to 12,000 years old. The subject of these carvings have been of much interest over the years, as many of them depict animals and offer insight into the environment and symbolic world of early humans.</span></p>'),(3923,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">It is important to note that the discovery of petroglyphs in the Konkan region is considered highly significant, as it constitutes the first archaeological findings of prehistoric human activity in this coastal area. Today, the petroglyph sites of Ratnagiri are included in UNESCO&rsquo;s Tentative List of World Heritage Sites. Their age, scale, and the questions they raise about early life in the region continue to draw interest from researchers and conservationists alike.</span></p>'),(3925,'<p class=\"c21\"><span class=\"c2\">Another significant trace of early human presence in the Ratnagiri district has emerged from the recent discovery of Megalithic-era remains near the Gambhireshwar (Gango) Mandir in Kumbhavade village, located in Rajapur taluka. This discovery, made in 2025 by researcher Satish Lalit, is considered highly important. For, as Dhaval Kulkarni (2025) notes, </span><span class=\"c2 c15\">&ldquo;this is the first time that megalithic-era memorials have been found along the Konkan coastline in the state.&rdquo;</span></p>'),(3927,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">Among the finds are seven \'menhirs,&rsquo; tall, upright stone pillars, identified by Lalit. These megalithic monuments are arranged in three distinct clusters near the Mandir. Carved from locally available laterite (jambha stone), five of the menhirs still stand, while two have toppled. Notably, all the structures are oriented along an east&ndash;west axis, which may indicate intentional orientation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">Menhirs are a significant element of Megalithic cultures and are typically interpreted as memorials for the dead. Its presence here, in many ways, provides new material evidence of human occupation in the region here during the Megalithic period and also extends the known geographic spread of Megalithic practices.</span></p>'),(3929,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">Across centuries, many legends have emerged around the origins of places including the Konkan region. One particularly fascinating tale is tied to Chiplun, a town which has historically served as a major commercial and trade center in Ratnagiri district. According to local tradition and texts like the Skanda Purana, the city&rsquo;s origin is tied to the Chitpavan Brahmins, a community said to have been created by Parshuram, the sixth avatar of Vishnu.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">The Sahyadri Khanda, which is believed to be a later addition to the Skanda Purana, narrates of how &nbsp;Parshuram (regarded as the sixth avatar of Vishnu), in search of purification after his campaign against the Kshatriyas, reclaimed land from the sea, now known as Konkan, and sought Brahmins to perform Vedic rituals on it. The legend claims that he revived fourteen corpses washed ashore after a shipwreck, purifying them on a funeral pyre and bringing them back to life. These resurrected individuals became known as Chitpavan (literally &ldquo;pure from the pyre&rdquo;). While epic in tone, the story likely hints at an early maritime migration of Brahmins to the Konkan coast and the reason why Chiplun is considered to be one of the earliest settlements of this community.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">Today, this legacy is reflected in the Parshuram Mandir in Chiplun, believed to have been built in the 18th century, with some sources attributing its construction to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.</span></p>'),(3932,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">By the 2nd century BCE, it appears that Ratnagiri had begun to draw the attention of traders, monks, and maritime travelers. In towns like Chiplun and Kol, Buddhist rock-cut caves were excavated into the hillsides. While there are no direct records linking specific rulers to these constructions, historical patterns suggest that the Satavahana dynasty, who succeeded the Mauryas in the Deccan and Konkan regions, may have patronized these structures. These were likely used as viharas (monastic quarters) and chaityas (prayer halls), with some caves featuring stupas, sculptures, and inscriptions. </span></p>'),(3934,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">These viharas and chaityas may have provided shelter to monks and merchants traveling along the trade routes, many of which threaded inland through passes like Kumbharli Ghat or connected to coastal ports like Dabhol, Bankot, and Palshet. It is important to note that Ratnagiri district was a prominent trade center during this time, so much so that it is believed that the well-known Greek maritime text, </span><span class=\"c2 c15\">The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">&nbsp;(1st century CE), refers to one of these ports. The ancient port of Palaepatmai is generally identified with present-day Palshet, which remained active as a harbor until the seventeenth century.</span></p>'),(3937,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">From the 3rd century CE onwards, Buddhist activity in the Ratnagiri region grew steadily, leaving enduring marks on its landscape. Numerous rock-cut caves attest to this flourishing monastic life, with Panhale Kaji standing as one of the largest and most significant sites. This complex, comprising twenty-nine caves, was first excavated by the Hinayana sect and later expanded under the Vajrayana tradition during the 10th and 11th centuries CE. Inscriptions in early Brahmi and later Devanagari scripts record continuous occupation and reflect the changing nature of religious practice over the centuries. Smaller but noteworthy caves at Chiplun (known as the Panch Pandav Caves) and at Khed further illustrate the extent of Buddhist influence in the district. Notably, M.N. Deshpande (1986), suggests that the mercantile community of Dabhol likely supported both the excavation of these caves and the sustenance of the resident monks.</span></p>'),(3939,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">By the early medieval period, Jainism had likewise established a presence in Ratnagiri. While its influence during the Satavahana era remains uncertain, by the 10th century CE, Jain communities were sufficiently prominent to leave behind sculptures of Tirthankaras, remains of Mandirs, and monolithic shrines, found notably at Konzar and Dabhol. The colonial district Gazetteer (1880) mentions that during the medieval period, Jainism held the status of a state religion in parts of the district.</span></p>'),(3943,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">Following Satavahana decline, Ratnagiri likely fell under the Western Kshatrapas, particularly during the reign of Rudradaman I (c. 130&ndash;150 CE), whose conquests are noted to have extended across Gujarat, Malwa, and coastal Konkan. Their influence persisted until about the early 5th century, when Mauryas of Konkan appear to have filled the vacuum.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">According to the Gazetteer (1880), by the 6th century, the Chalukyas of Badami had extended their reach into southern Ratnagiri, gradually pushing out the local Mauryas by 634 CE. It is possible that suggests that both dynasties may have coexisted for a period, before Chalukyan control was firmly established.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">In the </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">9th century</span><span class=\"c2\">, the </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Rathods of Hyderabad</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;briefly held power before the emergence of the </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Shilahara dynasty</span><span class=\"c2\">, who had been feudatories of the Rashtrakutas. The Shilaharas governed Konkan through </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">three branches</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"c33 lst-kix_861d91yd49xu-0 start\">\n<li class=\"c0 c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c7 c2 c26\">North Konkan<br></span></li>\n<li class=\"c0 c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c26 c7 c2\">Kolhapur&ndash;Satara region<br></span></li>\n<li class=\"c0 c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c7 c2\">Sapata-Konkana</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">&nbsp;(South Konkan, including modern Goa and parts of Ratnagiri)<br></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">The </span><span class=\"c2 c7\">Sapata-Konkana branch</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;ruled from about </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">765 CE to 1020 CE</span><span class=\"c2\">. Following their decline, </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">copperplate inscriptions</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;from around </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">1070 CE</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;show that </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">North Konkan Shilaharas</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">&nbsp;extended their control over the region.</span></p>'),(3945,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">The significance of Panhale-Kaji (briefly mentioned above), interestingly, grows during this later Shilahara phase. MN Deshpande (1986) in his ASI report notes that the village is mentioned in two 12th-century Shilahara inscriptions as Pranalaka. </span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">One, published by Dr. Shobhana Gokhale in Itihasa ani Samskriti (vol. XXIX), refers to a copperplate grant dated 9 October 1139 CE (Saka 1061). Issued by Aparaditya I, the grant bestows the village of Khairadi, located in the visaya of Pranalaka, to a Brahmin named Rudrabhattopadhyaya from Varanasi. </span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">A second inscription from 1156 CE (Saka 1078) records the appointment of Supraya as the dandadhipati (administrator) of Pranalaka desha, with a directive to make Pranala his capital. Despande writes, &ldquo;it is also stipulated that his oldest son should succeed him and make the same city his headquarters,&rdquo; suggesting the administrative importance of the site.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">From these inscriptions, Deshpande mentions that, it appears that Vikramaditya, a favored son of Aparaditya I, was appointed around 1138 CE to govern southern Konkan with Pranalaka as his capital. After Aparaditya&rsquo;s death, his son Haripaladeva likely took over North Konkan, while Vikramaditya continued to rule the south. No successors of Vikramaditya are known, and it is believed that Haripaladeva eventually reunited both regions under his rule.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Later, as the Rashtrakuta Empire waned, the Konkan region saw the rise of various smaller kingdoms. Amid this fragmentation, Ratnagiri experienced both the economic impact of trade and the social consequences of political instability. Frequent changes in rulership from the 12th to 14th centuries likely disrupted local governance and patronage in the region.</span></p>'),(3947,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">In the early 14th century, the district fell under the dominion of the Delhi Sultanate, which marked a significant shift in its political history. According to the Gazetteer (1880), when the Bahmanis established their independence in 1347, South Konkan became its natural seaboard, with Dabhol emerging as one of their notable strongholds. However, the inland areas of the district remained largely unconquered, likely due to their perceived lack of economic significance until the final years of their reign. The Gazetteer further notes that even during the Bahamani era, certain parts of the district maintained allegiance to the Vijayanagar Empire and the hold of the Islamic Kingdoms was rather slight.</span></p>'),(3949,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">As the Bahmani Empire fragmented in the late 15th century, especially after the death of its famed prime minister </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Mahmud Gawan</span><span class=\"c2\">, powerful successor states like the </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Adil Shahi dynasty of Bijapur</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;and the </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Nizam Shahis of Ahmadnagar</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">&nbsp;emerged.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">These new powers competed fiercely over the Konkan coastline:</span></p>\n<ul class=\"c33 lst-kix_z533ckdkvnb9-0 start\">\n<li class=\"c0 c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c7 c2\">Northern Ratnagiri</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;(near present-day Bankot) fell under </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Nizam Shahi</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">&nbsp;rule.<br></span></li>\n<li class=\"c0 c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c7 c2\">Southern Ratnagiri</span><span class=\"c2\">, including </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Dabhol</span><span class=\"c2\">, came under the </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Adil Shahis</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">.</span></li>\n</ul>'),(3951,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">During this period, Dabhol emerged as a principal port on the Konkan coast. The District Gazetteer (1962) describes its prosperity in detail, with the Russian traveller Afanasy Nikitin observing in the late 15th century that, &ldquo;the horses from Mysore, Arabia, Khorasan and Nighostan were brought here for trade. This was the place which had links with all major ports from India to Ethiopia.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Despite conflicts in the hinterland, Dabhol remained an active centre of trade throughout the 15th century. Its prosperity, however, drew the attention of the Portuguese, who, seeking to control Konkan trade, bombarded and sacked the port in December 1508. Though the fort withstood their assault, this marked the beginning of repeated Portuguese attempts to secure Dabhol.</span></p>'),(3953,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">As Dabhol flourished, Yusuf Adil Shah strengthened his hold over the coastal region. In 1502, he implemented the first recorded land revenue settlement for Ratnagiri. The system combined remnants of the Vijayanagar model with new measures: old revenue officers were retained, and a new class called khots was introduced in central Ratnagiri. These khots acted as revenue farmers and village headmen. Rice lands were taxed at one-sixth of the gross produce, usually in kind; hill lands (varkas or bharad) were taxed per plough (nangar). Waste lands were granted to officers to lease to settlers, and village communities paid light taxes with no extra cesses (sayar), creating a relatively simple system.</span></p>'),(3955,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">By the early 16th century, the flourishing port of Dabhol attracted the keen interest of the Portuguese, who were determined to dominate maritime trade along the Konkan coast. Don Lorenzo de Almeida, the Portuguese commander, wrote about Dabhol with clear admiration, showing how highly he valued the port. He described Dabhol as &ldquo; one of the most noted coast towns with a considerable trade and stately and magnificent buildings, girt with a wall, surrounded by country houses and fortified by a strong castle garrisoned by 6,000 men of whom 500 were Turks. &ldquo;</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">Based on their records indicate that Dabhol&rsquo;s prominence made it a port of considerable interest to them, prompting their determined efforts to secure it. This interest led to the first attack on Dabhol in 1508 CE, which resulted in its eventual capture from the Adil Shahi dynasty in 1510 CE. In response, the Adil Shahis took measures to strengthen the town&rsquo;s defences. Notably, they constructed the fort of Suvarnadurg near Harnai port to guard against threats from European colonial powers and rival local chiefs. In the 17th century, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the Peshwas, and the Angrias further improved and reinforced these coastal forts to ensure continued protection of trade routes and maritime settlements.</span></p>'),(3958,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">Following their initial conquest, the Portuguese maintained a presence at Dabhol and by 1535 had established a factory there. However, the port remained a site of frequent conflict, with repeated Adil Shahi attacks and tensions with other European powers. Portuguese naval expeditions targeted key ports and trade routes along the Konkan coast, seeking to control the region&rsquo;s maritime commerce. These conflicts often disrupted local trade and strained relations with other ruling powers.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">According to the district&rsquo;s Gazetteer (1962), despite the ongoing conflicts between the Bijapur Sultanate and the Portuguese in the district, the overall administration remained relatively stable during the 16th and the first half of the 17th century. This stability can be attributed in part to the efforts of Yusuf Adil Shah, who took measures to support the development of the district.</span></p>'),(3960,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">Perhaps one of the most enduring legacies of Portuguese influence in the Konkan region is the cultivation of the Alphonso mango. Named after Afonso de Albuquerque, the Portuguese general and administrator, this mango variety was introduced through grafting techniques brought by the Portuguese in the early 16th century.</span></p>'),(3962,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">The favourable coastal climate and soil of Ratnagiri allowed the Alphonso mango, locally called Hapus, to thrive. By the 17th century, it had become an important crop in the region and developed a reputation for its distinctive sweetness, aroma, and smooth texture. Over time, the Ratnagiri Alphonso gained recognition beyond local markets and is now regarded as one of India&rsquo;s finest mango varieties, exported widely and protected under a Geographical Indication (GI) tag.</span></p>'),(3964,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">In the early 17th century, European powers began competing for trading rights along the Konkan coast. The British made initial attempts to set up a trading factory at Dabhol but met resistance from the Portuguese, who had already established control over several coastal ports. By around 1638, the British succeeded in setting up a factory at Rajapur in Ratnagiri district, which served as a convenient entry point for trade with the cities of the Deccan. The French also opened a factory at Rajapur to benefit from the area&rsquo;s commercial links. However, both the British and French outposts were frequently attacked and plundered by the Marathas, who by this time had started to consolidate control over coastal and inland trade routes.</span></p>'),(3966,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">By the mid-17th century, the Maratha Empire, under Chhatrapati Shivaji, began expanding along the Konkan coast. Around 1658 CE, Shivaji initiated campaigns that consolidated Maratha control over much of South Konkan. To secure maritime trade and protect coastal settlements, he ordered the construction and repair of forts along the shoreline. According to historical accounts, except for Malvan &mdash; which was controlled by the Sawantwadi Rajas (See Sindhudurg for more) &mdash; Shivaji extended his authority over most of the coastal region. After Shivaji&rsquo;s death in 1680, there were many conflicts between the Mughals, the Portuguese, local Maratha commanders, and the Siddis which took place in the district.</span></p>'),(3968,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Between </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">1670 and 1680</span><span class=\"c2\">, when Shivaji briefly brought the Ratnagiri region under his control, he introduced significant reforms to the Maratha revenue system. According to the </span><span class=\"c2 c15\">Gazetteer</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;(1880), these reforms built upon the revenue methods earlier developed by </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Malik Ambar</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;in the Deccan during the early 17th century. Shivaji&rsquo;s policy was first carried out by </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Dadaji Konddev</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;and later refined by </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Annaji Dattu</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">, aiming to create a stable source of income for the state.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">The policy was first carried out by </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Dadaji Konddev</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;and later refined by </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Annaji Dattu</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">, with the main goal of creating a stable and predictable source of income for the state.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">A key feature of this system was the </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">precise measurement of farmland</span><span class=\"c2\">, especially rice fields. Officials used a standard rod that measured about the length from a person&rsquo;s elbow to the tip of the middle finger (known as a </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">cubit</span><span class=\"c2\">) plus five &ldquo;fists&rdquo; (each fist was roughly four inches or about 10 cm). The measured land was then divided into units called </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">bighas</span><span class=\"c2\">, with each bigha covering about </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">4,014 square yards</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">, which is roughly the size of a small sports field.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Land was then classified into twelve categories based on how fertile it was. These fell into three broad types: </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">rice lands</span><span class=\"c2\">, </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">hill lands</span><span class=\"c2\">, and </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">garden lands</span><span class=\"c2\">. The government claimed </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">40%</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">&nbsp;(or two-fifths) of the total produce as its share.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">To set fair tax amounts, officials checked how much crop the land typically produced. The harvest was measured in </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">bushels</span><span class=\"c2\">, which is an old unit for measuring grain and other crops &mdash; roughly equal to </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">35 litres</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;in modern terms. On the most fertile land, the standard tax was based on an expected harvest of about </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">57&frac12; bushels per acre</span><span class=\"c2\">; on poorer land, it was about </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">23 bushels per acre</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">For </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">hill land</span><span class=\"c2\">, the tax was calculated according to how many ploughs worked the land, with adjustments made for rocky or unproductive patches. </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Garden lands</span><span class=\"c2\">, which used to pay a fixed fee (called </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">kamal</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">), were now taxed by dividing the actual harvest evenly with the government.</span></p>'),(3970,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">After Shivaji&rsquo;s death in </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">1680</span><span class=\"c2\">, his son </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Sambhaji</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;succeeded him. During Sambhaji&rsquo;s reign, </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Kanhoji Angre</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;rose to prominence as the chief of the Maratha navy. From </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">1698</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">, Angre defended the Konkan coast against European colonial powers and other rivals. Leading the Maratha fleet, he launched repeated attacks on English and Portuguese ships attempting to dominate local ports.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">The </span><span class=\"c2 c15\">Gazetteer</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;(1880) records how Angre built and fortified several forts along the coast to secure his naval power. One notable fort connected to him is the </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Purnagad Fort</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">. It is believed that he constructed the fort likely to protect the region from foreign navies. The fort served as a base for defending and controlling maritime trade routes and launching raids against enemy ships.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">His legacy remains significant in Indian naval history. Notably, the Western Naval Command headquarters in Mumbai, INS Angre, is named after him. A port in Ratnagiri district also bears his name, recognising his impact on the region&rsquo;s maritime history.</span></p>'),(3972,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">After the death of Kanhoji Angria in 1728, one of his sons, Tulaji Angre, assumed control over the territory spanning from present-day Bankot in Raigad to Sawantwadi in Sindhudurg around 1745. During this period, the Maratha Empire\'s political structure had changed, with the title of Peshwa under Shahuji becoming the highest hereditary post. Tulaji, ruling over Raigad, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg, disregarded the authority of the Peshwa perhaps to maintain his independence. In response, according to the </span><span class=\"c2 c15\">Gazetteer</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">&nbsp;(1880), the Peshwa allied with the British to suppress Tulaji&rsquo;s power. By 1755, the Peshwa&rsquo;s forces, with British help, annexed all forts north of present-day Vijaydurg, including key sites in Ratnagiri. This marked the end of the Angre family&rsquo;s independent naval rule and brought the coastal forts firmly under the Maratha state, which would soon come under British control.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">Despite these changes, conflicts continued as neighbouring powers such as the Malvas of Kolhapur and the Savant of Sawantwadi opposed British moves in the region&rsquo;s ports. By the early 19th century, the entire Konkan coast, including Ratnagiri, came under British control.</span></p>'),(3975,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">During the first half of the 19th century, the administrative structure of Ratnagiri district was subject to several changes under British rule. Initially, it comprised nine subdivisions. However, in 1830, it was downgraded to the rank of a sub-collectorate. However, this demotion was short-lived and by </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">1832</span><span class=\"c2\">, the region was re-designated as a </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">collectorate (district)</span><span class=\"c2\">, now comprising </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">five subdivisions</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Further administrative modifications occurred in 1868 when the political boundary of the district was expanded. At that time, Ratnagiri district came to include </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">eight primary subdivisions</span><span class=\"c2\">&mdash;</span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Dapoli, Chiplun, Guhagar, Sangameshvar, Ratnagiri, Rajapur, Devgad, and Malvan</span><span class=\"c2\">, alongside </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">four smaller administrative units</span><span class=\"c2\">, referred to as </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">petty divisions</span><span class=\"c2\">: </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Mandangad, Khed, Lanje, and Vengurla</span><span class=\"c2\">. These petty divisions were administered under the jurisdiction of </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">magistrates\' courts</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">, reflecting a tiered system of colonial governance. These administrative changes were part of the broader restructuring of governance systems implemented during the British Raj.</span></p>'),(3977,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">Significant changes were also made to how land revenue was collected in the district. One of the most debated systems introduced under colonial administration was the khoti system, which became widespread after the Khot Act of 1880. Under this system, a khot was recognised as a middle-level landlord who held superior rights over village land and acted as an agent of the government for collecting taxes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">The khots collected revenue from tenant farmers and passed a share to the colonial state, but they also kept a portion for themselves. In practice, this gave them considerable power over tenant families, who depended on the land for their livelihood. Typically, tenants paid the khot through fixed payments called jama, which covered the official tax (dada) as well as the khot&rsquo;s own share of the harvest (baha nakt). This grain rent was usually fixed at rates lower than the market price and then converted into cash by the Collector&rsquo;s office every year.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">Although the government sometimes offered special leases (kaul) for projects like reclaiming swamps or dunes, these benefits rarely reached ordinary tenants or khots. Instead, the system allowed the khots to maintain control and extract extra dues from poorer cultivators &mdash; especially from communities like the Kunbis, Bhandaris, Mahars (Dalits), and other marginalised groups. Growing resentment against this system would later play an important role in local movements for farmers&rsquo; rights and land reform and eventually find wider support during India&rsquo;s freedom movement, drawing the attention of leaders like Dr B. R. Ambedkar (see more below). </span></p>'),(3979,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">The district has a long association with India&rsquo;s early nationalist movement and was home to leaders who played key roles in shaping its direction. Among them, </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Gopal Krishna Gokhale</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;was known for his work in social reform and his opposition to caste barriers. He supported gradual self-government and encouraged public service through the </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Servants of India Society</span><span class=\"c2\">, which he founded in 1905. To share his views and promote debate, he also launched </span><span class=\"c2 c15\">The Hitavada</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">, an English weekly newspaper. Gokhale is often remembered as an important mentor to Mahatma Gandhi during the formative years of the freedom movement.</span></p>'),(3981,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Another key figure from the district was </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Bal Gangadhar Tilak</span><span class=\"c2\">, who played an early and influential role in the demand for </span><span class=\"c2 c15\">Swaraj</span><span class=\"c2\">, or self-rule. He encouraged the use of local festivals such as </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Ganesh Chaturthi</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;as opportunities for community gathering and political discussion. He also promoted the legacy of </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Shivaji</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">&nbsp;to strengthen regional identity and unity. Tilak helped establish organisations that supported education, print media, and civic action, leaving a mark on the early national movement.</span></p>'),(3983,'<p class=\"c36\"><span class=\"c2\">Bal Gangadhar Tilak</span><sup class=\"c2\"><a id=\"ftnt_ref11\" href=\"#ftnt11\">[11]</a></sup></p>'),(3985,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Ratnagiri district also saw strong participation during the Civil Disobedience Movement. In 1930, local leaders and volunteers joined the </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Salt Satyagraha.</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">&nbsp;Volunteers travelled from village to village, teaching people how to make salt in defiance of the colonial salt tax. Over forty meetings were held across the district to encourage local participation, leading to numerous local salt marches. One of the most significant satyagrahas in the region took place at Shiroda, which at that time was part of Ratnagiri.</span></p>'),(3988,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">Under British rule, Ratnagiri&rsquo;s agriculture and local economy suffered due to policies of resource extraction and neglect. Author Manorama Savur (1982) contends that, upon Ratnagiri falling under British control, its agriculture suffered significant degradation within a short period of time. This decline is attributed to rampant deforestation and exploitation of labor. Additionally, the two primary sectors of the district&rsquo;s economy&mdash;namely, the manufacture of salt and local artisan industry&mdash;either received minimal encouragement or were subjected to government monopolies.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">Moreover, through a deliberate policy of uneven development, the British effectively relegated the district to a status of reserve labor force. This strategy ensured that the region served as a ready pool of labor for the benefit of the Indian ruling classes. Consequently, Ratnagiri\'s economic potential was stifled, and its inhabitants were subjected to exploitation and marginalization under British colonial rule.</span></p>'),(3990,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">By the 1930s, frustration with the </span><span class=\"c2 c15\">khoti</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;system (which is mentioned above) and broader exploitation had become part of the national conversation. In 1937, Dr B. R. Ambedkar introduced a bill in the Bombay Legislative Assembly calling for the abolition of the </span><span class=\"c2 c15\">khoti</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;system. His visit to Ratnagiri in 1938 energised local campaigns, with leaders like Tanaji Mahadev Gudekar and Sambhaji Tukaram Gaikwad mobilising farmers through groups such as the Ratnagiri Zilla Shetkari Parishad and the Chiplun Shetkari Parishad. Despite these efforts, the khoti system continued until it was finally abolished in Maharashtra in 1950. </span></p>'),(3992,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">After the Quit India Movement was declared in 1942, people in the district became active participants in the campaign against British rule. To contain the protests, the British administration arrested senior Congress leaders early on. These arrests led to widespread resentment across the region.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">In several parts of the district, residents took steps to disrupt official communication by cutting post and telegraph wires. Some groups also damaged government buildings and other facilities. In Malvan (now part of Sindhudurg), protesters set fire to the taluka office and the treasury, which resulted in financial losses for the colonial administration estimated at several lakh rupees. Such events illustrate how the district contributed to the larger Quit India Movement and remained connected to the final stages of India&rsquo;s independence struggle.</span></p>'),(3994,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">One of the more unusual episodes in Ratnagiri&rsquo;s colonial history comes from its role as the place of exile for King Thibaw Min, the last king of Burma. After the British annexed Upper Burma following the Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1885, they decided to keep the deposed monarch far from his homeland to prevent any unrest.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">In April 1886, King Thibaw, his queen Supayalat, and their daughters were brought to Ratnagiri, where a 30-room residence &mdash; now known as Thibaw Palace &mdash; was built for them. Though grand in size, life in the palace was marked by isolation and strict oversight. The exiled royal family faced financial hardships, and it is said that the king had to sell his prized Burmese rubies to maintain the household. King Thibaw remained in Ratnagiri until his death in 1916, leaving behind a lesser-known yet enduring link between the district and Southeast Asian history.</span></p>'),(3998,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">With India gaining independence from British rule in 1947, Ratnagiri, along with other princely states and regions, became part of the Indian Union. This transition from colonial rule to independent governance marked a significant political shift, with the district coming under the jurisdiction of the Indian government. It was made part of the New Bombay State until the State Reorganisation took place.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">In 1960, the state of Bombay underwent significant changes, leading to the creation of linguistic states such as Maharashtra and Gujarat. As a result, Ratnagiri, which was previously under the Bombay Presidency, became a district within the newly formed state of Maharashtra. In </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">1981</span><span class=\"c2\">, the southern portion of the district was separated to form </span><span class=\"c7 c2\">Sindhudurg district.</span></p>'),(4000,'<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c3 c2\">In recent decades, the region&rsquo;s traditional produce has gained national recognition. In 2016, &lsquo;Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri Kokum&rsquo; received Geographical Indication (GI) status from the Geographical Indications Registry of India. This certification acknowledges that Kokum grown in this part of the Konkan coast has unique qualities linked to its place of origin and traditional methods of cultivation and processing.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Kokum holds an important place in the local diet and culture, it is widely used in </span><span class=\"c2 c15\">sol kadhi</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;(a refreshing drink), curries, and sherbets. Historical records show that during the mid-19th century, Kokum was already being exported from Malvan under the rule of the Sawant Rajas. According to the </span><span class=\"c2 c15\">District Gazetteer</span><span class=\"c3 c2\">&nbsp;(1880), Kokum from Malvan was shipped to other Konkan ports, showing its long-standing economic value to the region.</span></p>');

INSERT INTO `home_district` VALUES (1,'Pune','pune','<p>Pune, located in western Maharashtra, derives its name from \"Punya Nagari,\" meaning \"City of Virtue\" in Sanskrit. The earliest&nbsp;reference to this name appears in a Rashtrakuta copper plate from 937 AD, where the region was called \"Punya-Vishaya\" or \"Punak-Vishaya.\" Over time, it evolved into \"Kasbe Pune\" or \"Punavadi\" before settling on its current name.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Historically, Pune has been central to Maharashtra&rsquo;s history for over 400 years. It was ruled by the Deccan Sultanates before becoming a stronghold of the Maratha Empire. The region is home to several forts, shrines, and historical sites from these periods. During British rule, Pune served as the monsoon capital of the Bombay Presidency, and remnants of colonial architecture and parks remain. After India&rsquo;s independence in 1947, Pune was integrated into Bombay State, later becoming part of Maharashtra in 1960. Today, Pune district consists of 15 talukas: Pune City, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Haveli, Mulshi, Velhe, Bhor, Purandar, Baramati, Daund, Indapur, Maval, Khed, Shirur, Ambegaon, and Junnar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Marathi is the official and most widely spoken language in Pune, though Hindi, English, and Kannada are also spoken due to the city\'s diverse population and status as an educational and industrial hub.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Geographically, Pune lies on the western edge of the Deccan Plateau, in the leeward shadow of the Sahyadri mountain range.

Some interpretations suggest a connection to the Sanskrit word Vashini, meaning \"one who controls\" or \"a sacred place\". Another perspective connects \"Washim\" to the Arabic name \"Basim,\" meaning \"the one that smiles.\" The correlation comes from the early contacts of the city with Arabs traders and migrants.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The district has been ruled by several dynasties, including the Satavahanas, Vakatakas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, and Yadavas of Devagiri, followed by the Bahmani and Mughal empires.
