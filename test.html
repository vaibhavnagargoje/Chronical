        >There have been many changes in the food culture of Pune in the recent
        decades. The traditional Maharashtrian cuisine like chapati-bhaji with
        dal-rice, and the occasional chicken or mutton dishes on the weekends,
        was the usual dietary habit of Punekars. However, with the rapid
        urbanization of the city and establishment of various IT parks, it has
        resulted in changing dietary habits. Restaurateur and socialite Karen
        Anand explains, &ldquo;I have noticed the rise of stand-alone
        restaurants offering a range of cuisines and people eating out rather
        than cooking at home while entertaining as two important trends in the
        food scene of the city.&rdquo;</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c32">
      <span class="c6 c2"
        >The staple diet of Punekars has shifted from food grains like millets
        and pulses to cash crops like sugarcane, cotton, and maize. Nowadays,
        the manner in which people consume milk has also changed. Earlier,
        people preferred fresh milk directly from gaushalas, but now people are
        okay with packaged milk. Chitale Dairy and Katraj Dairy are the popular
        packaged milk companies preferred by Punekars.

    <p class="c7">
      <span class="c6 c2"
        >Further, the development of Pune has also diversified the food palate
        of the district. Numerous fruits and vegetables that are not native to
        the district have become extremely popular are sourced from different
        regions of the country. Fruits like dragon fruit, tangerine, avocado,
        lichi and pear are loved by many Punekars. Similarly, vegetables like
        broccoli, parsley, lettuce, tinda &nbsp;have gained immense popularity.

      <span class="c2"
        >However, in this fast-changing and evolving food culture, the Peths or
        the central old areas of the city still promise to preserve their
        heritage and their diets.

        >ough it seems like Pune&rsquo;s food culture is dominated by
        vegetarianism, in the recent decades this has seen a major shift. The
        socio-economic development and urbanization of the city and its talukas
        have resulted in the popularization of non-veg food in the city. Chicken
        and mutton now seem to occupy an important place in the average
        Punekar&rsquo;s diet. However, it is noteworthy that it is the
        communities such as the Muslims, Marathas, Kayasthas and Saraswats that
        primarily consume non-veg food. Most Brahmins and Jains have continued
        to stand by the vegetarian diet.

    </h1>
    <p class="c7">
      <span class="c6 c2"
        >Punekars typically have their breakfast during the morning hours. A
        typical breakfast begins with the famous Misal-Pav, a traditional
        Maharashtrian dish that consists of misal, a curry made from moth beans
        (matki usal), potatoes (batata bhaji), farsan, and poha, served
        alongside a pair of pav (bread). The curry, or rassa, is served
        separately and can be added according to personal preference. It is
        available in three spice levels: light, medium spicy, and extremely
        spicy. Normally, Puneri misal is complemented with a glass of chilled
        buttermilk (taak), which balances the spiciness of the misal. Some
        popular misal spots in Pune include Bedekar Misal, Vaidya Uphar Gruha,
        Katakirr Misal, and Bhadait Misal.</span

    <p class="c7">
      <span class="c6 c2"
        >Lunch is generally served during the midday hours, and a common joke
        about this time is the phrase, &nbsp;&ldquo;We are closed from 1 to 3
        PM,&rdquo; as many eatery staff take their lunch breaks during this
        period. The last meal of the day, dinner, is typically during the
        evening hours.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c7">
      <span class="c2"
        >In addition to these three main meals, people usually enjoy a tea or
        coffee break between lunch and dinner. Evening beverages are often
        accompanied by snacks known as namkeen. One of the most famous snacks
        that any Punekar will mention is Chitale Bandhu&rsquo;s Bakarwadi. This
        snack is a favorite among locals and is frequently recommended to
        non-locals and tourists. The recipe has been kept secret and passed down
        through generations by Chitale Bandhu since 1950. Although primarily a
        Gujarati snack, it is beloved by Maharashtrians; today, Chitale sells
        approximately 6,000 kg of Bakarwadi daily. Other popular snacks in the
        district include Dhokla, Papadi, and various types of Shev and Chiwda,
        prepared by companies like Haldiram, Chitale, as well as cooperatives
        and individual shops.</span

        post-meal digestives. There is also a trend of consuming digestives

        chicken/mutton dishes found in talukas like Indapur, Daund, Saswad,
        Baramati, and Shirur. The mutton prepared in these talukas is referred
        to as &lsquo;kala (black) mutton&rsquo; which is spicy, has a
        distinctive brown-black colour, and is relished with the traditional
        jowar/bajra bhakri. Hotel Jagdamba situated in Khed-Shivapur on the
        Pune-Bangalore Highway is famous for &lsquo;kala mutton&rsquo; and
        bhakri with tupvaati (bowl of special melted ghee) which is applied on
        the bhakri to give the customer a softer aftertaste. Otherwise, Pune is
        known for having a sweet palate.</span

        and finds its way into households by early April. Mangoes are sliced,
        pulped, and mixed to prepare aamras with the addition of elaichi
        (cardamom) for garnishing. When it comes to grains, Wheat is used
        throughout the year, Bajra is preferred in winters and jowar is mostly

        run by Vishwanath Gogavale, the 3rd generation of the Gujar family. The
